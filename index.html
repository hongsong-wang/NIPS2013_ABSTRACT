Using a Gaussian process prior over the drift as a function of the state vector, we develop an approximate EM algorithm to deal with the unobserved, latent dynamics between observations. The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process and the MAP estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process regression.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">42</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Christian Albers, Maren Westkott, Klaus Pawelzik</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/22fb0cee7e1f3bde58293de743871417-Paper.pdf">Perfect Associative Learning with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Recent extensions of the Perceptron, as e.g. the Tempotron, suggest that this theoretical concept is highly relevant also for understanding networks of spiking neurons in the brain. It is not known, however, how the computational power of the Perceptron and of its variants might be accomplished by the plasticity mechanisms of real synapses. Here we prove that spike-timing-dependent plasticity having an anti-Hebbian form for excitatory synapses as well as a spike-timing-dependent plasticity of Hebbian shape for inhibitory synapses are sufficient for realizing the original Perceptron Learning Rule if the respective plasticity mechanisms act in concert with the hyperpolarisation of the post-synaptic neurons. We also show that with these simple yet biologically realistic dynamics Tempotrons are efficiently learned. The proposed mechanism might underly the acquisition of mappings of spatio-temporal activity patterns in one area of the brain onto other spatio-temporal spike patterns in another region and of long term memories in cortex. Our results underline that learning processes in realistic networks of spiking neurons depend crucially on the interactions of synaptic plasticity mechanisms with the dynamics of participating neurons.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">50</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Josh S Merel, Roy Fox, Tony Jebara, Liam Paninski</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/286674e3082feb7e5afb92777e48821f-Paper.pdf">A multi-agent control framework for co-adaptation in brain-computer interfaces</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">In a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI), adaptive decoders are used to learn parameters suited to decoding the user's neural response. Feedback to the user provides information which permits the neural tuning to also adapt. We present an approach to model this process of co-adaptation between the encoding model of the neural signal and the decoding algorithm as a multi-agent formulation of the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem. In simulation we characterize how decoding performance improves as the neural encoding and adaptive decoder optimize, qualitatively resembling experimentally demonstrated closed-loop improvement. We then propose a novel, modified decoder update rule which is aware of the fact that the encoder is also changing and show it can improve simulated co-adaptation dynamics. Our modeling approach offers promise for gaining insights into co-adaptation as well as improving user learning of BCI control in practical settings.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">7</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Harikrishna Narasimhan, Shivani Agarwal</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Paper.pdf">On the Relationship Between Binary Classification, Bipartite Ranking, and Binary Class Probability Estimation</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We investigate the relationship between three fundamental problems in machine learning: binary classification, bipartite ranking, and binary class probability estimation (CPE). It is known that a good binary CPE model can be used to obtain a good binary classification model (by thresholding at 0.5), and also to obtain a good bipartite ranking model (by using the CPE model directly as a ranking model); it is also known that a binary classification model does not necessarily yield a CPE model. However, not much is known about other directions. Formally, these relationships involve regret transfer bounds. In this paper, we introduce the notion of weak regret transfer bounds, where the mapping needed to transform a model from one problem to another depends on the underlying probability distribution (and in practice, must be estimated from data). We then show that, in this weaker sense, a good bipartite ranking model can be used to construct a good classification model (by thresholding at a suitable point), and more surprisingly, also to construct a good binary CPE model (by calibrating the scores of the ranking model).</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">13</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Ian Goodfellow, Mehdi Mirza, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/0bb4aec1710521c12ee76289d9440817-Paper.pdf">Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We introduce the Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machine (MP-DBM).

Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classification tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time.

Unfortunately, domain modeling is a laborious and error-prone task, thus real world agents have to plan with incomplete domain models. While domain experts cannot guarantee completeness, often they are able to circumscribe the incompleteness of the model by providing annotations as to which parts of the domain model may be incomplete. In such cases, the goal should be to synthesize plans that are robust with respect to any known incompleteness of the domain. In this paper, we first introduce annotations expressing the knowledge of the domain incompleteness and formalize the notion of plan robustness with respect to an incomplete domain model. We then show an approach to compiling the problem of finding robust plans to the conformant probabilistic planning problem, and present experimental results with Probabilistic-FF planner.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">53</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Navid Zolghadr, Gabor Bartok, Russell Greiner, András György, Csaba Szepesvari</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/291597a100aadd814d197af4f4bab3a7-Paper.pdf">Online Learning with Costly Features and Labels</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">This paper introduces the online probing" problem: In each round, the learner is able to purchase the values of a subset of feature values. After the learner uses this information to come up with a prediction for the given round, he then has the option of paying for seeing the loss that he is evaluated against. Either way, the learner pays for the imperfections of his predictions and whatever he chooses to observe, including the cost of observing the loss function for the given round and the cost of the observed features. We consider two variations of this problem, depending on whether the learner can observe the label for free or not. We provide algorithms and upper and lower bounds on the regret for both variants.

However, while the EP framework in theory allows for complex non-Gaussian factors, there is still a significant practical barrier to using them within EP, because doing so requires the implementation of message update operators, which can be difficult and require hand-crafted approximations. In this work, we study the question of whether it is possible to automatically derive fast and accurate EP updates by learning a discriminative model e.g., a neural network or random forest) to map EP message inputs to EP message outputs.  We address the practical concerns that arise in the process, and we provide empirical analysis on several challenging and diverse factors, indicating that there is a space of factors where this approach appears promising.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">27</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Giovanni Zappella</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/18997733ec258a9fcaf239cc55d53363-Paper.pdf">A Gang of Bandits</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Multi-armed bandit problems are receiving a great deal of attention because they adequately formalize the exploration-exploitation trade-offs arising in several industrially relevant applications, such as online advertisement and, more generally, recommendation systems.  In many cases, however, these applications have a strong social component, whose integration in the bandit algorithm could lead to a dramatic performance increase. For instance, we may want to serve content to a group of users by taking advantage of an underlying network of social relationships among them. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithmic approaches to the solution of such networked bandit problems. More specifically, we design and analyze a global strategy which allocates a bandit algorithm to each network node (user) and allows it to “share” signals (contexts and payoffs) with the neghboring nodes. We then derive two more scalable variants of this strategy based on different ways of clustering the graph nodes. We experimentally compare the algorithm and its variants to state-of-the-art methods for contextual bandits that do not use the relational information. Our experiments, carried out on synthetic and real-world datasets, show a marked increase in prediction performance obtained by exploiting the network structure.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">20</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Michalis Titsias RC AUEB, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/115f89503138416a242f40fb7d7f338e-Paper.pdf">Variational Inference for Mahalanobis Distance Metrics in Gaussian Process Regression</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We introduce a novel variational method that allows to approximately integrate out kernel hyperparameters, such as length-scales, in Gaussian process regression.

As our first main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD($\lambda$)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of soft-greedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward any optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations, the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">80</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">José Bento, Nate Derbinsky, Javier Alonso-Mora, Jonathan S.

As part of the proposed approach we develop a generalization of the Max-Path search algorithm, which allows us to efficiently search over a structured space of multiple spatio-temporal paths, while also allowing to incorporate context information into the model. Instead of using spatial annotations, in the form of bounding boxes, to guide the latent model during training, we utilize human gaze data in the form of a weak supervisory signal. This is achieved by incorporating gaze, along with the classification, into the structured loss within the latent SVM learning framework. Experiments on a challenging benchmark dataset, UCF-Sports, show that our model is more accurate, in terms of classification, and achieves state-of-the-art results in localization. In addition, we show how our model can produce top-down saliency maps conditioned on the classification label and localized latent paths.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">8</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Mohammad Gheshlaghi azar, Alessandro Lazaric, Emma Brunskill</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/062ddb6c727310e76b6200b7c71f63b5-Paper.pdf">Sequential Transfer in Multi-armed Bandit with Finite Set of Models</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is critical for building lifelong learning agents.

Moreover, random label noise is \emph{class-conditional} --- the flip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisfies a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efficient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classification with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence --- methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88\% accuracy even when 40\% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">79</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Paramveer Dhillon, Yichao Lu, Dean P.

We propose a robust graph matching algorithm inspired in sparsity-related techniques. We cast the problem, resembling group or collaborative sparsity formulations, as a non-smooth convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using augmented Lagrangian techniques. The method can deal with weighted or unweighted graphs, as well as multimodal data, where different graphs represent different types of data. The proposed approach is also naturally integrated with collaborative graph inference techniques, solving general network inference problems where the observed variables, possibly coming from different modalities, are not in correspondence. The algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art graph matching techniques in both synthetic and real graphs.

In this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex sets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all the cycles. Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the partition function has complexity $O(k^{2}n)$  using message-passing algorithms, where k  is the size of the FVS, and n  is the total number of nodes. We propose efficient structure learning algorithms for two cases: 1) All nodes are observed, which is useful in modeling social or flight networks where the FVS nodes often correspond to a small number of high-degree nodes, or hubs, while the rest of the networks is modeled by a tree. Regardless of the maximum degree, without knowing the full graph structure, we can exactly compute the maximum likelihood estimate in $O(kn^2+n^2\log n)$  if the FVS is known or in polynomial time if the FVS is unknown but has bounded size. 2) The FVS nodes are latent variables, where structure learning is equivalent to decomposing a inverse covariance matrix (exactly or approximately) into the sum of a tree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. By incorporating efficient inference into the learning steps, we can obtain a learning algorithm using alternating low-rank correction with complexity $O(kn^{2}+n^{2}\log n)$  per iteration. We also perform experiments using both synthetic data as well as real data of flight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of various sizes. We show that empirically the family of GGMs of size $O(\log n)$ strikes a good balance between the modeling capacity and the efficiency.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">92</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Yanshuai Cao, Marcus A Brubaker, David J Fleet, Aaron Hertzmann</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/46922a0880a8f11f8f69cbb52b1396be-Paper.pdf">Efficient Optimization for Sparse Gaussian Process Regression</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression.

In this paper, we specify which overcomplete models can be identified given observable moments of a certain order. We consider   probabilistic admixture or topic models  in the overcomplete regime, where the number of latent topics can greatly exceed the size of the observed word vocabulary. While   general  overcomplete topic models are not   identifiable, we establish {\em generic} identifiability under  a  constraint, referred to as  {\em topic persistence}. Our sufficient conditions for identifiability involve a novel set of higher order'' expansion conditions on   the {\em topic-word matrix} or the {\em population structure}   of the   model. This set of higher-order expansion conditions allow for overcomplete models, and require  the existence of a perfect  matching from latent topics to higher order observed words. We establish that random structured topic models are identifiable w.h.p. in the overcomplete regime. Our identifiability results allow for   general (non-degenerate) distributions for modeling the topic proportions, and thus, we can handle arbitrarily correlated topics in our framework.  Our identifiability results imply uniqueness of a class of tensor decompositions with structured sparsity which is contained in the class of {\em Tucker} decompositions, but is more general than the {\em Candecomp/Parafac} (CP)   decomposition."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">4</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Elias Bareinboim, Sanghack Lee, Vasant Honavar, Judea Pearl</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/02522a2b2726fb0a03bb19f2d8d9524d-Paper.pdf">Transportability from Multiple Environments with Limited Experiments</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">This paper considers the problem of transferring experimental findings learned from multiple heterogeneous domains to a target environment, in which only limited experiments can be performed.

We consider two variations of PI: Howard's PI that changes the actions in all states with a positive advantage, and Simplex-PI that only changes the action in the state with maximal advantage. We show that Howard's PI terminates after at most  $ O \left( \frac{ n m}{1-\gamma} \log \left( \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \right)\right) $ iterations, improving by a factor $O(\log n)$ a result by Hansen et al.

Under some structural assumptions of the MDP, we then consider bounds that are independent of the discount factor~$\gamma$: given a measure of the maximal transient time $\tau_t$ and the maximal time $\tau_r$ to revisit states in recurrent classes under all policies, we show that Simplex-PI terminates after at most $ \tilde O \left( n^3 m^2 \tau_t \tau_r \right) $ iterations. This generalizes a recent result for deterministic MDPs by Post &amp; Ye (2012), in which $\tau_t \le n$ and $\tau_r \le n$. We explain why similar results seem hard to derive for Howard's PI. Finally, under the additional (restrictive) assumption that the state space is partitioned in two sets, respectively states that are transient and recurrent for all policies, we show that Simplex-PI and Howard's PI terminate after at most  $ \tilde O(nm (\tau_t+\tau_r))$ iterations.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">5</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jason Lee, Yuekai Sun, Jonathan E Taylor</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/0266e33d3f546cb5436a10798e657d97-Paper.pdf">On model selection consistency of penalized M-estimators: a geometric theory</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Penalized M-estimators are used in diverse areas of science and engineering to fit high-dimensional models with some low-dimensional structure.

Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identified start and finish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to finish node.

This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. For randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, this problem can be efficiently solved. We show that it also can be efficiently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses.  When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we present an efficient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs.

For example, given a background corpus of news articles together with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains word patterns and themes specific to the author. Another example comes from genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive learning for  mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring mixture components specific to a foreground data set when contrasted with a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">93</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">David Pfau, Eftychios A Pnevmatikakis, Liam Paninski</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/47a658229eb2368a99f1d032c8848542-Paper.pdf">Robust learning of low-dimensional dynamics from large neural ensembles</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Recordings from large populations of neurons make it possible to search for hypothesized low-dimensional dynamics.

The results can be combined with spectral methods to learn dynamical systems models. The basic method can be seen as an extension of PCA to the exponential family using nuclear norm minimization. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method using an exact decomposition of the Bregman divergence that is analogous to variance explained for PCA. We show on model data that the parameters of latent linear dynamical systems can be recovered, and that even if the dynamics are not stationary we can still recover the true latent subspace. We also demonstrate an extension of nuclear norm minimization that can separate sparse local connections from global latent dynamics.

Our result provides for the first time a rigorous solution of the mean field equations for the standard Hopfield model and is in contrast to the mathematically unjustifiable replica technique that has been hitherto used for this derivation. We show that the critical temperature for stability of a strong pattern is equal to its degree or multiplicity, when sum of the cubes of degrees of all stored patterns is negligible compared to the network size. In the case of a single strong pattern in the presence of simple patterns, when the ratio of the number of all stored patterns and the network size is a positive constant, we obtain the distribution of the overlaps of the patterns with the mean field and deduce that the storage capacity for retrieving a strong pattern exceeds that for retrieving a simple pattern by a multiplicative factor equal to the square of the degree of the strong pattern. This square law property provides justification for using strong patterns to model attachment types and behavioural prototypes in psychology and psychotherapy.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">51</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Eunho Yang, Pradeep K Ravikumar, Genevera I Allen, Zhandong Liu</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/28f0b864598a1291557bed248a998d4e-Paper.pdf">Conditional Random Fields via Univariate Exponential Families</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Conditional random fields, which model the distribution of a multivariate response conditioned on a set of covariates using undirected graphs, are widely used in a variety of multivariate prediction applications. Popular instances of this class of models such as categorical-discrete CRFs, Ising CRFs, and conditional Gaussian based CRFs, are not however best suited to the varied types of response variables in many applications, including count-valued responses. We thus introduce a “novel subclass of CRFs”, derived by imposing node-wise conditional distributions of response variables conditioned on the rest of the responses and the covariates as arising from univariate exponential families.  This allows us to derive novel multivariate CRFs given any univariate exponential distribution, including the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential distributions. Also in particular, it addresses the common CRF problem of specifying feature'' functions determining the interactions between response variables and covariates. We develop a class of tractable penalized $M$-estimators to learn these CRF distributions from data, as well as a unified sparsistency analysis for this general class of CRFs showing exact structure recovery can be achieved with high probability."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">18</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Karthika Mohan, Judea Pearl, Jin Tian</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/0ff8033cf9437c213ee13937b1c4c455-Paper.pdf">Graphical Models for Inference with Missing Data</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We address the problem of deciding whether there exists a consistent estimator of a given relation Q, when data are missing not at random.

In this context, we develop new estimators for the $\ell_2$ estimation risk $\|\hat{\theta}-\theta_0\|_2$ and the variance of the noise. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein unbiased risk estimate (Stein'81) and recent results of (Bayati and Montanari'11-12) on the analysis of approximate message passing and risk of LASSO.  We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices $X$ of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on the validity of a certain conjecture from statistical physics.

In the case that the optimization problem is ill-conditioned, we need to evaluate a larger number of full gradients, which could be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to reduce the number of full gradient required by allowing the algorithm to access the stochastic gradients of the objective function. To this end, we present a novel algorithm named Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD) that is able to utilize two kinds of gradients.  A distinctive step in EMGD is the mixed gradient descent, where we use an combination of the gradient and the stochastic gradient to update the intermediate solutions. By performing a fixed number of mixed gradient descents, we are able to improve the sub-optimality of the solution by a constant factor, and thus achieve a linear convergence rate. Theoretical analysis shows that EMGD is able to find an $\epsilon$-optimal solution by computing $O(\log 1/\epsilon)$ full gradients and $O(\kappa^2\log 1/\epsilon)$ stochastic gradients.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">113</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard L.

We propose a method for a graph to capture the manifold structure of input features using edge weights parameterized by a similarity function. In this approach, edge weights represent both similarity and local reconstruction weight simultaneously, both being reasonable for label propagation. For further justification, we provide analytical considerations including an interpretation as a cross-validation of a propagation model in the feature space, and an error analysis based on a low dimensional manifold model.

Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of objects, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes.  This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually defined semantic or visual features for either words or images.  Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class.

In this work, we study the label complexity of active learning algorithms that request labels in a given number of batches, as well as the tradeoff between the total number of queries and the number of rounds allowed. We additionally study the total cost sufficient for learning, for an abstract notion of the cost of requesting the labels of a given number of examples at once.

In our paper we develop the first practical algorithm for Independent Component Analysis that is provably invariant under Gaussian noise. The two main contributions of this work are as follows: 1. We develop and implement a more efficient version of a Gaussian noise invariant decorrelation (quasi-orthogonalization) algorithm using Hessians of the cumulant functions. 2. We propose a very simple and efficient fixed-point GI-ICA (Gradient Iteration ICA) algorithm, which is compatible with quasi-orthogonalization, as well as with the usual PCA-based whitening in the noiseless case.  The algorithm is based on a special form of gradient iteration (different from gradient descent).

The new approximation is justified using a recent convex analysis tool---proximal average, and yields a novel proximal gradient algorithm that is strictly better than the one based on smoothing, without incurring any extra overhead.

We study a class of restricted Structural Equation Models for time series that we call Time Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo). These models require independent residual time series, whereas traditional methods like Granger causality exploit the variance of residuals. This work contains two main contributions: (1) Theoretical: By restricting the model class (e.g. to additive noise) we provide more general identifiability results than existing ones. The results cover lagged and instantaneous effects that can be nonlinear and unfaithful, and non-instantaneous feedbacks between the time series. (2) Practical: If there are no feedback loops between time series, we propose an algorithm based on non-linear independence tests of time series. When the data are causally insufficient, or the data generating process does not satisfy the model assumptions, this algorithm may still give partial results, but mostly avoids incorrect answers. The Structural Equation Model point of view allows us to extend both the theoretical and the algorithmic part to situations in which the time series have been measured with different time delays (as may happen for fMRI data, for example). TiMINo outperforms existing methods on artificial and real data.

In this paper, we develop a regret bound that holds for both classes of algorithms. This bound applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. It depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards.

In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the $k$ players to communicate \emph{only once}, they are able to learn $\sqrt{k}$ times faster than a single player. That is, distributing learning to $k$ players gives rise to a factor~$\sqrt{k}$ parallel speed-up. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible.

Formally, the model can be described as convolutional sparse block coding. For inference we use a variant of convolutional matching pursuit adapted to block-based representations. We extend the K-SVD learning algorithm to subspaces by retaining several principal vectors from the SVD decomposition instead of just one. Good models with little cross-talk between subspaces can be obtained by learning the blocks incrementally. We perform extensive experiments on simulated images and the inference algorithm consistently recovers a large proportion of the cells with a small number of false positives. We fit the convolutional model to noisy GCaMP6 two-photon images of spiking neurons and to Nissl-stained slices of cortical tissue and show that it recovers cell body locations without supervision.

Specifically, our method finds a set of word $k$-grams that minimizes the cost of reconstructing the text losslessly. We formulate document compression as a binary optimization task and show how to solve it approximately via a sequence of reweighted linear programs that are efficient to solve and parallelizable. As our method is unsupervised, features may be extracted once and subsequently used in a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the performance of these features over a range of scenarios including unsupervised exploratory analysis and supervised text categorization. Our compressed feature space is two orders of magnitude smaller than the full $k$-gram space and matches the text categorization accuracy achieved in the full feature space.

Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration, in particular, when one needs to average a function with respect to one probability distribution, given a sample from another. It is often referred as {\it importance sampling} in statistical inference and is  also closely related to the problem of {\it covariate shift} in transfer learning as well as to various MCMC methods. Our approach is based on reformulating the problem of estimating the ratio as an inverse problem in terms of an integral operator corresponding to a kernel, and thus reducing it to an integral equation, known as the Fredholm problem of the first kind.   This formulation, combined with the techniques of regularization and kernel methods, leads to a principled kernel-based framework for constructing algorithms and for analyzing them theoretically.  The resulting family of algorithms (FIRE, for Fredholm Inverse Regularized Estimator) is flexible,  simple and  easy to implement. We provide detailed theoretical analysis including concentration bounds and convergence rates for the Gaussian kernel for densities defined on $\R^d$ and smooth $d$-dimensional sub-manifolds of the Euclidean space. Model selection for unsupervised or semi-supervised inference is generally a difficult problem. Interestingly, it turns out that in the density ratio estimation setting, when samples from both distributions are available, there are simple completely unsupervised methods for choosing parameters.

By exploiting the sparsity of neural spiking we demonstrate that the number of measurements needed per timestep is significantly smaller than the total number of neurons, a result that can potentially enable imaging of larger populations at considerably faster rates compared to traditional raster-scanning techniques. Unlike traditional CS setups, our problem involves a block-diagonal sensing matrix and a non-orthogonal sparse basis that spans multiple timesteps. We study the effect of these distinctive features in a noiseless setup using recent results relating conic geometry to CS. We provide tight approximations to the number of measurements needed for perfect deconvolution for certain classes of spiking processes, and show that this number displays a phase transition," similar to phenomena observed in more standard CS settings; however, in this case the required measurement rate depends not just on the mean sparsity level but also on other details of the underlying spiking process."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">120</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Stefanie Jegelka, Francis Bach, Suvrit Sra</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/5dd9db5e033da9c6fb5ba83c7a7ebea9-Paper.pdf">Reflection methods for user-friendly submodular optimization</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Recently, it has become evident that submodularity naturally captures widely occurring concepts in machine learning, signal processing and computer vision.

In contrast to previous approaches, our method is neither approximate, nor impractical, nor does it need any cumbersome parameter tuning. Moreover, it is easy to implement and parallelize. A key component of our approach is a formulation of the discrete submodular minimization problem as a continuous best approximation problem. It is solved through a sequence of reflections and its solution can be  automatically thresholded to obtain an optimal discrete solution. Our method solves both the continuous and discrete formulations of the problem, and therefore has applications in learning, inference, and reconstruction.

However, Bayesian learning is often obstructed by computational difficulty: the rigorous Bayesian learning is  intractable in many models, and its variational Bayesian (VB) approximation is prone to suffer from local minima. In this paper, we overcome this difficulty for low-rank subspace clustering (LRSC) by providing an exact global solver and its efficient approximation. LRSC extracts a low-dimensional structure of data by embedding  samples into the union of low-dimensional subspaces, and its variational Bayesian variant has shown good performance. We first prove a key property that the VB-LRSC model is highly redundant. Thanks to this property, the optimization problem of VB-LRSC can be separated into small subproblems, each of which has only a small number of unknown variables. Our exact global solver relies on another key property that the stationary condition of each subproblem is written as a set of polynomial equations, which is solvable with the homotopy method. For further computational efficiency,  we also propose an efficient approximate variant, of which the stationary condition can be written as a polynomial equation with a single variable.

Such models allow us to specify the distribution over the number of features per data point, and can achieve better performance on data sets where the number of features is not well-modeled by the original distribution.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">109</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Trevor Campbell, Miao Liu, Brian Kulis, Jonathan P How, Lawrence Carin</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/53c3bce66e43be4f209556518c2fcb54-Paper.pdf">Dynamic Clustering via Asymptotics of the Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">This paper presents a novel algorithm, based upon the dependent Dirichlet process mixture model (DDPMM), for clustering batch-sequential data containing an unknown number of evolving clusters.

This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise.  We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty).</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">123</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Adrien Todeschini, François Caron, Marie Chavent</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/5ef0b4eba35ab2d6180b0bca7e46b6f9-Paper.pdf">Probabilistic Low-Rank Matrix Completion with Adaptive Spectral Regularization Algorithms</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose a novel class of algorithms for low rank matrix completion.

Consequently, successful blind deconvolution for removing shake artifacts requires the estimation of a spatially-varying or non-uniform blur operator.  Using ideas from Bayesian inference and convex analysis, this paper derives a non-uniform blind deblurring algorithm with several desirable, yet previously-unexplored attributes.  The underlying objective function includes a spatially-adaptive penalty that couples the latent sharp image, non-uniform blur operator, and noise level together.  This coupling allows the penalty to automatically adjust its shape based on the estimated degree of local blur and image structure such that regions with large blur or few prominent edges are discounted.  Remaining regions with modest blur and revealing edges therefore dominate the overall estimation process without explicitly incorporating structure-selection heuristics.  The algorithm can be implemented using an optimization strategy  that is virtually parameter free and simpler than existing methods.  Detailed theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real images serve to validate the proposed method.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">125</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Leonidas Lefakis, François Fleuret</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/6081594975a764c8e3a691fa2b3a321d-Paper.pdf">Reservoir Boosting : Between Online and Offline Ensemble Learning</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose to train an ensemble with the help of a reservoir in which the learning algorithm can store a limited number of samples.

We consider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal about the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at each time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is dynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario as an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while suffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global loss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an estimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of the underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a bounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady state mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per individual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal MSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on the learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the proposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter in a finite time.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">130</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, James R Lloyd, Daniel Hernández-Lobato</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/67d16d00201083a2b118dd5128dd6f59-Paper.pdf">Gaussian Process Conditional Copulas with Applications to Financial Time Series</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series.

To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables.

We show that the existence of such a quartet allows us to uniquely identify each latent variable and to learn all parameters involving that latent variable. Underlying our algorithm are two new techniques for structure learning: a quartet test to determine whether a set of binary variables are singly coupled, and a conditional mutual information test that we use to learn parameters. We also show how to subtract already learned latent variables from the model to create new singly-coupled quartets, which substantially expands the class of structures that we can learn.

We study an alternative approach for efficient exploration, posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient and allows an agent to encode prior knowledge in a natural way. We establish an $\tilde{O}(\tau S \sqrt{AT} )$ bound on the expected regret, where $T$ is time, $\tau$ is the episode length and $S$ and $A$ are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This bound is one of the first for an algorithm not based on optimism and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm.

Maximum entropy (or maxent'') models, which   seek to explain dependencies in terms of low-order interactions   between neurons, have enjoyed remarkable success in modeling such   patterns, particularly for small groups of neurons. However, these   models are computationally intractable for large populations, and   low-order maxent models have been shown to be inadequate for some   datasets.  To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of   "universal'' models for binary spike patterns, where universality   refers to the ability to model arbitrary distributions over all   $2^m$ binary patterns.  We construct universal models using a   Dirichlet process centered on a well-behaved parametric base   measure, which naturally combines the flexibility of a histogram and   the parsimony of a parametric model.  We derive computationally   efficient inference methods using Bernoulli and cascade-logistic   base measures, which scale tractably to large populations.

For active learning on GRFs, the commonly used V-optimality criterion queries nodes that reduce the L2 (regression) loss. V-optimality satisfies a submodularity property showing that greedy reduction produces a (1 − 1/e) globally optimal solution. However, L2 loss may not characterise the true nature of 0/1 loss in classification problems and thus may not be the best choice for active learning. We consider a new criterion we call Σ-optimality, which queries the node that minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance. Σ-optimality directly optimizes the risk of the surveying problem, which is to determine the proportion of nodes belonging to one class. In this paper we extend submodularity guarantees from V-optimality to Σ-optimality using properties specific to GRFs. We further show that GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition in addition to the conditional independence inherited from Markov random fields. We test Σ-optimality on real-world graphs with both synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on classification.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">133</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Mijung Park, Jonathan W Pillow</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/68a83eeb494a308fe5295da69428a507-Paper.pdf">Bayesian inference for low rank spatiotemporal neural receptive fields</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">The receptive field (RF) of a sensory neuron describes how the   neuron integrates sensory stimuli over time and space. In typical   experiments with naturalistic or flickering spatiotemporal stimuli,   RFs are very high-dimensional, due to the large number of   coefficients needed to specify an integration profile across time   and space.  Estimating these coefficients from small amounts of data   poses a variety of challenging statistical and computational   problems.  Here we address these challenges by developing Bayesian   reduced rank regression methods for RF estimation. This corresponds   to modeling the RF as a sum of several space-time separable (i.e.,   rank-1) filters, which proves accurate even for neurons with   strongly oriented space-time RFs.  This approach substantially   reduces the number of parameters needed to specify the RF, from   1K-100K down to mere 100s in the examples we consider, and confers   substantial benefits in statistical power and computational   efficiency.  In particular, we introduce a novel prior over low-rank   RFs using the restriction of a matrix normal prior to the manifold   of low-rank matrices. We then use a localized'' prior over row and   column covariances to obtain sparse, smooth, localized estimates of   the spatial and temporal RF components.  We develop two methods for   inference in the resulting hierarchical model: (1) a fully Bayesian   method using blocked-Gibbs sampling; and (2) a fast, approximate   method that employs alternating coordinate ascent of the conditional   marginal likelihood.  We develop these methods under Gaussian and   Poisson noise models, and show that low-rank estimates substantially   outperform full rank estimates in accuracy and speed using neural   data from retina and V1."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">158</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Crystal Maung, Haim Schweitzer</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7a53928fa4dd31e82c6ef826f341daec-Paper.pdf">Pass-efficient unsupervised feature selection</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">The goal of unsupervised feature selection is to identify a small number of important features that can represent the data. We propose a new algorithm, a modification of the classical pivoted QR algorithm of Businger and Golub, that requires a small number of passes over the data. The improvements are based on two ideas: keeping track of multiple features in each pass, and skipping calculations that can be shown not to affect the final selection. Our algorithm selects the exact same features as the classical pivoted QR algorithm, and has the same favorable numerical stability. We describe experiments on real-world datasets which sometimes show improvements of {\em several orders of magnitude} over the classical algorithm. These results appear to be competitive with  recently proposed randomized algorithms in terms of pass efficiency and run time. On the other hand, the randomized algorithms may produce better features, at the cost of small probability of failure.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">166</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Martin Mevissen, Emanuele Ragnoli, Jia Yuan Yu</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7f39f8317fbdb1988ef4c628eba02591-Paper.pdf">Data-driven Distributionally Robust Polynomial Optimization</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider robust optimization for polynomial optimization problems where the uncertainty set is a set of candidate probability density functions.

Advances in recording technology provide access to an ever larger fraction of the population, but the standard computational approaches available to identify the collective dynamics scale poorly with the size of the dataset. Here we describe a new, scalable approach to discovering the low-dimensional dynamics that underlie simultaneously recorded spike trains from a neural population. Our method is based on recurrent linear models (RLMs), and relates closely to timeseries models based on recurrent neural networks. We formulate RLMs for neural data by generalising the Kalman-filter-based likelihood calculation for latent linear dynamical systems (LDS) models to incorporate a generalised-linear observation process. We show that RLMs describe motor-cortical population data better than either directly-coupled generalised-linear models or latent linear dynamical system models with generalised-linear observations. We also introduce the cascaded linear model (CLM) to capture low-dimensional instantaneous correlations in neural populations. The CLM describes the cortical recordings better than either Ising or Gaussian models and, like the RLM, can be fit exactly and quickly. The CLM can also be seen as a generalization of a low-rank Gaussian model, in this case factor analysis. The computational tractability of the RLM and CLM allow both to scale to very high-dimensional neural data.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">170</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Francis Bach, Eric Moulines</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7fe1f8abaad094e0b5cb1b01d712f708-Paper.pdf">Non-strongly-convex smooth stochastic approximation with convergence rate O(1/n)</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider the stochastic approximation problem where a convex function has to be minimized, given only the knowledge of unbiased estimates of its gradients at certain points, a framework which includes machine learning methods based on the minimization of the empirical risk.

This limitation has led to a growing number of \emph{Preconditioned Lasso} algorithms that pre-multiply $X$ and $y$ by matrices $P_X$, $P_y$ prior to running the standard Lasso. A direct comparison of these and similar Lasso-style algorithms to the original Lasso is difficult because the performance of all of these methods depends critically on an auxiliary penalty parameter $\lambda$. In this paper we propose an agnostic, theoretical framework for comparing Preconditioned Lasso algorithms to the Lasso without having to choose $\lambda$.

Our algorithms accumulate information to estimate the local conditional distributions that constitute such a factorization. These stochastic inverses can be used to invert each of the computation steps leading to an observation, sampling backwards in order to quickly find a likely explanation.

They show impressive performance when calculating unconditional probabilities in relational models, but often resort to non-lifted inference when computing conditional probabilities.  The reason is that conditioning on evidence breaks many of the model's symmetries, which preempts standard lifting techniques.  Recent theoretical results show, for example, that conditioning on evidence which corresponds to binary relations is #P-hard, suggesting that no lifting is to be expected in the worst case. In this paper, we balance this grim result by identifying the Boolean rank of the evidence as a key parameter for characterizing the complexity of conditioning in lifted inference.  In particular, we show that conditioning on binary evidence with bounded Boolean rank is efficient. This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">171</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Misha Denil, Babak Shakibi, Laurent Dinh, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Nando de Freitas</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7fec306d1e665bc9c748b5d2b99a6e97-Paper.pdf">Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We demonstrate that there is significant redundancy in the parameterization of   several deep learning models.

Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns.

We present a new variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms. In particular, by exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is first approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence is optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential in only the cluster size of the graph.

Less studied, though equally pernicious, is the need to take account of dependencies between synaptic weights when decoding patterns previously encoded in an auto-associative memory. We show that activity-dependent learning generically produces such correlations, and failing to take them into account in the dynamics of memory retrieval leads to catastrophically poor recall. We derive optimal network dynamics for recall in the face of synaptic correlations caused by a range of synaptic plasticity rules. These dynamics involve well-studied circuit motifs, such as forms of feedback inhibition and experimentally observed dendritic nonlinearities.

Here, $p$-dimensional samples are presented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the $k$-dimensional subspace that best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require $O(p^2)$ memory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than $O(kp)$ memory, since this is what the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most meaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample complexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in the setting of the {\em spiked covariance model}, where $p$-dimensional points are generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise) plus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be recovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the number of samples, $n$, scales proportionally with the dimension, $p$. Yet, all algorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity $O(p^2)$. Meanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity $O(kp)$ do not have provable bounds on sample complexity comparable to $p$. We present an algorithm that achieves both: it uses $O(kp)$ memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able to compute the $k$-dimensional spike with $O(p \log p)$ sample-complexity -- the first algorithm of its kind.

A Probabilistic Generative Approach</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We study optimal image encoding based on a generative approach with non-linear feature combinations and explicit position encoding. By far most approaches to unsupervised learning learning of visual features, such as sparse coding or ICA, account for translations by representing the same features at different positions. Some earlier models used a separate encoding of features and their positions to facilitate invariant data encoding and recognition. All probabilistic generative models with explicit position encoding have so far assumed a linear superposition of components to encode image patches. Here, we for the first time apply a model with non-linear feature superposition and explicit position encoding. By avoiding linear superpositions, the studied model represents a closer match to component occlusions which are ubiquitous in natural images. In order to account for occlusions, the non-linear model encodes patches qualitatively very different from linear models by using component representations separated into mask and feature parameters. We first investigated encodings learned by the model using artificial data with mutually occluding components. We find that the model extracts the components, and that it can correctly identify the occlusive components with the hidden variables of the model. On natural image patches, the model learns component masks and features for typical image components. By using reverse correlation, we estimate the receptive fields associated with the model's hidden units. We find many Gabor-like or globular receptive fields as well as fields sensitive to more complex structures. Our results show that probabilistic models that capture occlusions and invariances can be trained efficiently on image patches, and that the resulting encoding represents an alternative model for the neural encoding of images in the primary visual cortex.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">161</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Wojciech Samek, Duncan Blythe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Motoaki Kawanabe</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7bcdf75ad237b8e02e301f4091fb6bc8-Paper.pdf">Robust Spatial Filtering with Beta Divergence</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">The efficiency of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) largely depends upon a reliable extraction of informative features from the high-dimensional EEG signal. A crucial step in this protocol is the computation of spatial filters. The Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) algorithm computes filters that maximize the difference in band power between two conditions, thus it is tailored to extract the relevant information in motor imagery experiments. However, CSP is highly sensitive to artifacts in the EEG data, i.e. few outliers may alter the estimate drastically and decrease classification performance. Inspired by concepts from the field of information geometry we propose a novel approach for robustifying CSP. More precisely, we formulate CSP as a divergence maximization problem and utilize the property of a particular type of divergence, namely beta divergence, for robustifying the estimation of spatial filters in the presence of artifacts in the data.

A critical challenge of cross language learning lies in that words of different languages are in disjoint feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a two-step representation learning method to bridge the feature spaces of different languages by exploiting a set of parallel bilingual documents. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst formulate a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix for all documents in two languages, and then induce a cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing on the obtained matrix. We use a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the formulated matrix completion problem with convergence guarantees. The proposed approach is evaluated by conducting a set of experiments with cross language sentiment classiﬁcation tasks on Amazon product reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning approach outperforms a number of comparison cross language representation learning methods, especially when the number of parallel bilingual documents is small.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">151</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Bruno Scherrer</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/7504adad8bb96320eb3afdd4df6e1f60-Paper.pdf">Approximate Dynamic Programming Finally Performs Well in the Game of Tetris</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Tetris is a popular video game that has been widely used as a benchmark for various optimization techniques including approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. A close look at the literature of this game shows that while ADP algorithms, that have been (almost) entirely based on approximating the value function (value function based), have performed poorly in Tetris, the methods that search directly in the space of policies by learning the policy parameters using an optimization black box, such as the cross entropy (CE) method, have achieved the best reported results. This makes us conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent, and thus, learn than their corresponding value functions. So, in order to obtain a good performance with ADP, we should use ADP algorithms that search in a policy space, instead of the more traditional ones that search in a value function space. In this paper, we put our conjecture to test by applying such an ADP algorithm, called classification-based modified policy iteration (CBMPI), to the game of Tetris. Our extensive experimental results show that for the first time an ADP algorithm, namely CBMPI, obtains the best results reported in the literature for Tetris in both small $10\times 10$ and large $10\times 20$ boards. Although the CBMPI's results are similar to those achieved by the CE method in the large board, CBMPI uses considerably fewer (almost 1/10) samples (call to the generative model of the game) than CE.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">182</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Behnam Neyshabur, Nati Srebro, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Yury Makarychev, Payman Yadollahpour</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/84438b7aae55a0638073ef798e50b4ef-Paper.pdf">The Power of Asymmetry in Binary Hashing</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance between short binary hashes, we shown that even if the similarity is symmetric, we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two distinct code maps.

The proposed Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS) algorithm represents the uncertainty of the accumulated reward for actions in the MCTS search tree as a mixture of Normal distributions and inferences on it in Bayesian settings by choosing conjugate priors in the form of combinations of Dirichlet and NormalGamma distributions.

To understand the functional contribution of such molecular complexity to learning and memory, it is essential to expand our theoretical conception of a synapse from a single scalar to an entire dynamical system with many internal molecular functional states. Moreover, theoretical considerations alone demand such an expansion; network models with scalar synapses assuming finite numbers of distinguishable synaptic strengths have strikingly limited memory capacity. This raises the fundamental question, how does synaptic complexity give rise to memory? To address this, we develop new mathematical theorems elucidating the relationship between the structural organization and memory properties of complex synapses that are themselves molecular networks. Moreover, in proving such theorems, we uncover a framework, based on first passage time theory, to impose an order on the internal states of complex synaptic models, thereby simplifying the relationship between synaptic structure and function.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">193</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jie Wang, Jiayu Zhou, Peter Wonka, Jieping Ye</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8b16ebc056e613024c057be590b542eb-Paper.pdf">Lasso Screening Rules via Dual Polytope Projection</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Lasso is a widely used regression technique to find sparse representations. When the dimension of the feature space and the number of samples are extremely large, solving the Lasso problem remains challenging. To improve the efficiency of solving large-scale Lasso problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed the SAFE rules which are able to quickly identify the inactive predictors, i.e., predictors that have $0$ components in the solution vector. Then, the inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization problem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its dual form, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set of inactive constraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective screening rule via Dual Polytope Projections (DPP), which is mainly based on the uniqueness and nonexpansiveness  of the optimal dual solution due to the fact that the feasible set in the dual space is a convex and closed polytope. Moreover, we show that our screening rule can be extended to identify inactive groups in group Lasso. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no exact" screening rule for group Lasso. We have evaluated our screening rule using many real data sets. Results show that our rule is more effective to identify inactive predictors than existing state-of-the-art screening rules for Lasso."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">184</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Baharan Mirzasoleiman, Amin Karbasi, Rik Sarkar, Andreas Krause</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/84d2004bf28a2095230e8e14993d398d-Paper.pdf">Distributed Submodular Maximization: Identifying Representative Elements in Massive Data</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Many large-scale machine learning problems (such as clustering, non-parametric learning, kernel machines, etc.) require selecting, out of a massive data set, a manageable, representative subset.

We show that any efficient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efficient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classification noise as well as other forms of uncorrelated" noise. The complexity of the resulting algorithms has information-theoretically optimal quadratic dependence on $1/(1-2\eta)$, where $\eta$ is the noise rate.  We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efficiently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the first known computationally-efficient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classification noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error $\epsilon$ over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efficient active differentially-private algorithms.

The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufficient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects.  In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More specifically, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., finding sensible responses for a tweet, or  relevant answers to a given question.

It is also a richer and broader notion than what most metric learning algorithms can model. For example, similarity can arise from the process of aggregating the decisions of multiple latent components, where each latent component compares data in its own way by focusing on a different subset of features. In this paper, we propose Similarity Component Analysis (SCA), a probabilistic graphical model that discovers those latent components from data. In SCA, a latent component generates a local similarity value, computed with its own metric, independently of other components. The final similarity measure is then obtained by combining the local similarity values with a (noisy-)OR gate. We derive an EM-based algorithm for fitting the model parameters with similarity-annotated data from pairwise comparisons. We validate the SCA model on synthetic datasets where SCA discovers the ground-truth about the latent components. We also apply SCA to a multiway classification task and a link prediction task. For both tasks, SCA attains significantly better prediction accuracies than competing methods. Moreover, we show how SCA can be instrumental in exploratory analysis of data, where we gain insights about the data by examining patterns hidden in its latent components' local similarity values.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">197</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Shouyuan Chen, Michael R Lyu, Irwin King, Zenglin Xu</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8c235f89a8143a28a1d6067e959dd858-Paper.pdf">Exact and Stable Recovery of Pairwise Interaction Tensors</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Tensor completion from incomplete observations is a problem of significant practical interest.

In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training.

Moreover, the assumption of equal background across all classes/topics may be too strong. This paper extends to propose sparse additive model with low rank background (SAM-LRB), and simple yet efficient estimation. Particularly, by employing a double majorization bound, we approximate the log-likelihood into a quadratic lower-bound with the sum-of-exp terms absent. The constraints of low rank and sparsity are then simply embodied by nuclear norm and $\ell_1$-norm regularizers. Interestingly, we find that the optimization task in this manner can be transformed into the same form as that in Robust PCA. Consequently, parameters of supervised SAM-LRB can be efficiently learned using an existing algorithm for Robust PCA based on accelerated proximal gradient. Besides the supervised case, we extend SAM-LRB to also favor unsupervised and multifaceted scenarios.

We give the first positive answer to this question for a {\em natural supervised learning problem} --- we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over $3$-sparse vectors in $\{-1,1,0\}^n$. This class is inefficiently learnable using $O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establishing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random $\mathrm{3CNF}$ formulas is hard, efficiently learning this class using $O\left(n/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples is impossible. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even $O\left(n^{1.499}/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples do not suffice.  On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efficiently using $\tilde{\Omega}\left(n^2/\epsilon^2\right)$ examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">222</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Christina E.

Standard methods involve large matrix multiplications as in power iteration, or simulations of long random walks to sample states from the stationary distribution, as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However these methods are computationally costly; either they involve operations at every state or they scale (in computation time) at least linearly in the size of the state space. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm that answers whether a chosen state in a MC has stationary probability larger than some $\Delta \in (0,1)$. If so, it estimates the stationary probability. Our algorithm uses information from a local neighborhood of the state on the graph induced by the MC, which has constant size relative to the state space. We provide correctness and convergence guarantees that depend on the algorithm parameters and mixing properties of the MC. Simulation results show MCs for which this method gives tight estimates.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">194</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Francesca Petralia, Joshua T Vogelstein, David B Dunson</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8b5040a8a5baf3e0e67386c2e3a9b903-Paper.pdf">Multiscale Dictionary Learning for Estimating Conditional Distributions</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Nonparametric estimation of the conditional distribution of a response given high-dimensional features is a challenging problem.  It is important to allow not only the mean but also the variance and shape of the response density to change flexibly with features, which are massive-dimensional.  We propose a multiscale dictionary learning model, which expresses the conditional response density as a convex combination of dictionary densities, with the densities used and their weights dependent on the path through a tree decomposition of the feature space.  A fast graph partitioning algorithm is applied to obtain the tree decomposition, with Bayesian methods then used to adaptively prune and average over different sub-trees in a soft probabilistic manner.  The algorithm scales efficiently to approximately one million features.

How can hidden, evolving trends in such data be extracted while preserving the tensor structure?  The model that is traditionally used is the linear dynamical system (LDS), which treats the observation at each time slice as a vector.  In this paper, we propose the multilinear dynamical system (MLDS) for modeling tensor time series and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters.  The MLDS models each time slice of the tensor time series as the multilinear projection of a corresponding member of a sequence of latent, low-dimensional tensors.

This problem comes up in many application areas, and has received a great deal of attention in the context of the netflix prize.  A central approach to this problem is to output a matrix of lowest  possible complexity (e.g. rank or trace norm) that agrees with the partially  specified matrix.  The performance of this approach under the assumption that the revealed entries are sampled randomly   has received considerable attention. In practice, often the set of revealed entries is not chosen at random and these results do not apply. We are therefore left with no guarantees on the performance of the algorithm we are using.  We present a means to obtain performance guarantees with respect to any set of initial observations.  The first  step remains the same: find a matrix of lowest possible complexity that agrees with the partially specified matrix.   We give a new way to interpret the output of this algorithm by next finding a probability distribution over  the non-revealed entries with respect to which a bound on the generalization error can be proven.  The more  complex the set of revealed entries according to a certain measure, the better the bound on the generalization  error.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">207</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/9232fe81225bcaef853ae32870a2b0fe-Paper.pdf">Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem.

We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used.

To understand this ability, we seek to construct models of the ventral stream, the series of cortical areas thought to subserve object recognition. One tool to assess the quality of a model of the ventral stream is the Representation Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM), which uses a set of visual stimuli and measures the distances produced in either the brain (i.e. fMRI voxel responses, neural firing rates) or in models (features). Previous work has shown that all known models of the ventral stream fail to capture the RDM pattern observed in either IT cortex, the highest ventral area, or in the human ventral stream. In this work, we construct models of the ventral stream using a novel optimization procedure for category-level object recognition problems, and produce RDMs resembling both macaque IT and human ventral stream. The model, while novel in the optimization procedure, further develops a long-standing functional hypothesis that the ventral visual stream is a hierarchically arranged series of processing stages optimized for visual object recognition.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">212</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Tim Roughgarden, Michael Kearns</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/94c7bb58efc3b337800875b5d382a072-Paper.pdf">Marginals-to-Models Reducibility</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider a number of classical and new computational problems regarding marginal distributions, and inference in models specifying a full joint distribution.

We extend previous Bayesian nonparamet- ric models of neural spiking to jointly detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model. Importantly, we develop an online approximate inference scheme enabling real-time analysis, with performance exceeding the previous state-of-the- art.

Our method benefits from the power of discriminative training of deep neural networks, at the same time using tree-based generative priors over classification parameters. We also propose an algorithm for learning the underlying tree structure. This gives the model some flexibility to tune the tree so that the tree is pertinent to task being solved. We show that the model can transfer knowledge across related classes using fixed semantic trees. Moreover, it can learn new meaningful trees usually leading to improved performance.

The major contributions are in two folds. First, in low dimensions and under a double asymptotic framework where both the dimension $d$ and sample size $n$ can increase, by borrowing the strength from recent development in minimax optimal principal component estimation, we first time sharply characterize the potential advantage of classical principal component regression over least square estimation under the Gaussian model. Secondly, we propose and analyze a new robust sparse principal component regression on high dimensional elliptically distributed data. The elliptical distribution is a semiparametric generalization of the Gaussian, including many well known distributions such as multivariate Gaussian, rank-deficient Gaussian, $t$, Cauchy, and logistic. It allows the random vector to be heavy tailed and have tail dependence. These extra flexibilities make it very suitable for modeling finance and biomedical imaging data. Under the elliptical model, we prove that our method can estimate the regression coefficients in the optimal parametric rate and therefore is a good alternative to the Gaussian based methods. Experiments on synthetic and real world data are conducted to illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed method.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">219</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jacob Abernethy, Satyen Kale</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/995e1fda4a2b5f55ef0df50868bf2a8f-Paper.pdf">Adaptive Market Making via Online Learning</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider the design of strategies for \emph{market making} in a market like a stock, commodity, or currency exchange.

Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov\'asz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random fields, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent.

An instructional policy specifies the manner and content of instruction. For example, in the domain of concept learning, a policy might specify the nature of exemplars chosen over a training sequence.  Traditional psychological studies compare several hand-selected policies, e.g., contrasting a policy that selects only difficult-to-classify exemplars with a policy that gradually progresses over the training sequence from easy exemplars to more difficult (known as {\em fading}). We propose an alternative to the traditional methodology in which we define a  parameterized space of policies and search this space to identify the optimum policy. For example, in concept learning, policies might be described by a fading function that specifies exemplar difficulty over time.  We propose an experimental technique for searching policy spaces using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization and a generative model of student performance. Instead of evaluating a few experimental conditions each with many human subjects, as the traditional methodology does, our technique evaluates many experimental conditions each with a few subjects.  Even though individual subjects provide only a noisy estimate of the population mean, the optimization method allows us to determine the shape of the policy space and identify the global optimum, and is as efficient in its subject budget as a traditional A-B comparison.  We evaluate the method via two behavioral studies, and suggest that the method has broad applicability to optimization problems involving humans in domains beyond the educational arena.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">214</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Chong Wang, Xi Chen, Alexander J Smola, Eric P Xing</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/9766527f2b5d3e95d4a733fcfb77bd7e-Paper.pdf">Variance Reduction for Stochastic Gradient Optimization</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Stochastic gradient optimization is a class of widely used algorithms for training machine learning models. To optimize an objective, it uses the noisy gradient computed from the random data samples instead of the true gradient computed from the entire dataset. However, when the variance of the noisy gradient is large, the algorithm might spend much time bouncing around, leading to slower convergence and worse performance. In this paper, we develop a general approach of using control variate for variance reduction in stochastic gradient. Data statistics such as low-order moments (pre-computed or estimated online) is used to form the control variate. We demonstrate how to construct the control variate for two practical problems using stochastic gradient optimization. One is convex---the MAP estimation for logistic regression, and the other is non-convex---stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation.

Some methods further limit the space of functions and settle for non-convex models.  In this paper, we propose a framework for learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using local invariances that explicitly characterize the behavior of the target function around data instances.  These invariances are \emph{compactly} encoded as linear functionals whose value are penalized by some loss function.  Based on a representer theorem that we establish, our formulation can be efficiently optimized via a convex program. For the representer theorem to hold, the linear functionals are required to be bounded in the RKHS, and we show that this is true for a variety of commonly used RKHS and invariances. Experiments on learning with unlabeled data and transform invariances show that the proposed method yields better or similar results compared with the state of the art.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">3</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Matthew Lawlor, Steven W Zucker</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/024d7f84fff11dd7e8d9c510137a2381-Paper.pdf">Third-Order Edge Statistics: Contour Continuation, Curvature, and Cortical Connections</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Association field models have been used to explain human contour grouping performance and to explain the mean frequency of long-range horizontal connections across cortical columns in V1.

Recently, it has been observed that for many text corpora documents evolve into one another in a smooth way, with some features dropping and new ones being introduced. The counting grid \cite{cgUai} models this spatial metaphor literally: it is multidimensional grid of word distributions learned in such a way that a document's own distribution of features can be modeled as the sum of the histograms found in a window into the grid. The major drawback of this method is that it is essentially a mixture and all the content much be generated by a single contiguous area on the grid. This may be problematic especially for lower dimensional grids. In this paper, we overcome to this issue with the \emph{Componential Counting Grid} which brings the componential nature of topic models to the basic counting grid. We also introduce a generative kernel based on the document's grid usage and a visualization strategy useful for understanding large text corpora. We evaluate our approach on document classification and multimodal retrieval obtaining state of the art results on standard benchmarks.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">225</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor, Shuicheng Yan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/9a96876e2f8f3dc4f3cf45f02c61c0c1-Paper.pdf">Online PCA for Contaminated Data</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider the online Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for contaminated samples (containing outliers) which are revealed sequentially to the Principal Components (PCs) estimator.

However, they face a fundamental limitation: given enough data, the number of nodes in decision trees will grow exponentially with depth. For certain applications, for example on mobile or embedded processors, memory is a limited resource, and so the exponential growth of trees limits their depth, and thus their potential accuracy. This paper proposes decision jungles, revisiting the idea of ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and shows these to be compact and powerful discriminative models for classification. Unlike conventional decision trees that only allow one path to every node, a DAG in a decision jungle allows multiple paths from the root to each leaf. We present and compare two new node merging algorithms that jointly optimize both the features and the structure of the DAGs efficiently. During training, node splitting and node merging are driven by the minimization of exactly the same objective function, here the weighted sum of entropies at the leaves. Results on varied datasets show that, compared to decision forests and several other baselines, decision jungles require dramatically less memory while considerably improving generalization.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">231</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/9e3cfc48eccf81a0d57663e129aef3cb-Paper.pdf">From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir (2011).

This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problem and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with $|\Vcal|$ nodes and $|\Ecal|$ edges to an accuracy of $\epsilon$ using  $n=O(1/\epsilon^2)$ randomizations and up to logarithmic factors $O(n|\Ecal|+n|\Vcal|)$ computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of nodes with an influence of at least $(1 - 1/e)\operatorname{OPT} - 2\epsilon$, where $\operatorname{OPT}$ is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">202</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8f121ce07d74717e0b1f21d122e04521-Paper.pdf">Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Robust PCA methods are typically based on batch optimization and have to load all the samples into memory.

We measure the player's performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary's adaptiveness to the player's behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize ---in a nearly complete manner--- the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switching costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is $T^{2/3}$. Interestingly, this rate is significantly worse than the $\sqrt{T}$ rate attainable with switching costs in the full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also show that a bounded memory adversary can force $T^{2/3}$ regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries.

However, applications of these ideas have usually been limited to 2D affine transformations, e.g., translation and scaling, since they are easiest to solve via convolution. In accord with a recent theory of transformation-invariance, we propose a model that, while capturing other common convolutional networks as special cases, can also be used with arbitrary identity-preserving transformations. The model's wiring can be learned from videos of transforming objects---or any other grouping of images into sets by their depicted object. Through a series of successively more complex empirical tests, we study the invariance/discriminability properties of this model with respect to different transformations. First, we empirically confirm theoretical predictions for the case of 2D affine transformations. Next, we apply the model to non-affine transformations: as expected, it performs well on face verification tasks requiring invariance to the relatively smooth transformations of 3D rotation-in-depth and changes in illumination direction. Surprisingly, it can also tolerate clutter transformations'' which map an image of a face on one background to an image of the same face on a different background. Motivated by these empirical findings, we tested the same model on face verification benchmark tasks from the computer vision literature: Labeled Faces in the Wild, PubFig and a new dataset we gathered---achieving strong performance in these highly unconstrained cases as well."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">244</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">George H Chen, Stanislav Nikolov, Devavrat Shah</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/a8849b052492b5106526b2331e526138-Paper.pdf">A Latent Source Model for Nonparametric Time Series Classification</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">For classifying time series, a nearest-neighbor approach is widely used in practice with performance often competitive with or better than more elaborate methods such as neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Our guiding hypothesis is that in many applications, such as forecasting which topics will become trends on Twitter, there aren't actually that many prototypical time series to begin with, relative to the number of time series we have access to, e.g., topics become trends on Twitter only in a few distinct manners whereas we can collect massive amounts of Twitter data. To operationalize this hypothesis, we propose a latent source model for time series, which naturally leads to a weighted majority voting" classification rule that can be approximated by a nearest-neighbor classifier. We establish nonasymptotic performance guarantees of both weighted majority voting and nearest-neighbor classification under our model accounting for how much of the time series we observe and the model complexity. Experimental results on synthetic data show weighted majority voting achieving the same misclassification rate as nearest-neighbor classification while observing less of the time series. We then use weighted majority to forecast which news topics on Twitter become trends, where we are able to detect such "trending topics" in advance of Twitter 79% of the time, with a mean early advantage of 1 hour and 26 minutes, a true positive rate of 95%, and a false positive rate of 4%."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">233</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Anirban Roychowdhury, Ke Jiang, Brian Kulis</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/a0e2a2c563d57df27213ede1ac4ac780-Paper.pdf">Small-Variance Asymptotics for Hidden Markov Models</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Small-variance asymptotics provide an emerging technique for obtaining scalable combinatorial algorithms from rich probabilistic models.

This analysis is then extended to the Bayesian nonparametric case, yielding a simple, scalable, and flexible algorithm for discrete-state sequence data with a non-fixed number of states. We also derive the corresponding combinatorial objective functions arising from our analysis, which involve a k-means-like term along with penalties based on state transitions and the number of states.

The GQM consists of a low-rank quadratic form followed by a point nonlinearity and exponential-family noise. The quadratic form characterizes the neuron's stimulus selectivity in terms of a set linear receptive fields followed by a quadratic combination rule, and the invertible nonlinearity maps this output to the desired response range. Special cases of the GQM include the 2nd-order Volterra model (Marmarelis and Marmarelis 1978, Koh and Powers 1985) and the elliptical Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson model (Park and Pillow 2011). Here we show that for canonical form" GQMs, spectral decomposition of the first two response-weighted moments yields approximate maximum-likelihood estimators via a quantity called the expected log-likelihood. The resulting theory generalizes moment-based estimators such as the spike-triggered covariance, and, in the Gaussian noise case, provides closed-form estimators under a large class of non-Gaussian stimulus distributions. We show that these estimators are fast and provide highly accurate estimates with far lower computational cost than full maximum likelihood. Moreover, the GQM provides a natural framework for combining multi-dimensional stimulus sensitivity and spike-history dependencies within a single model.

In this paper, we present a class of path kernels with computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2 (m + \delta^2))$, where $\delta$ is the graph diameter and $m$ the number of edges. Due to the sparsity and small diameter of real-world graphs, these kernels scale comfortably to large graphs.

We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [9, 23] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and, an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors.

To optimize such functions, humans utilize sophisticated sequential decision-making strategies. Many optimization algorithms have also been developed for this same purpose, but how do they compare to humans in terms of both performance and behavior? We try to unravel the general underlying algorithm people may be using while searching for the maximum of an invisible 1D function. Subjects click on a blank screen and are shown the ordinate of the function at each clicked abscissa location. Their task is to find the function’s maximum in as few clicks as possible. Subjects win if they get close enough to the maximum location. Analysis over 23 non-maths undergraduates, optimizing 25 functions from different families, shows that humans outperform 24 well-known optimization algorithms. Bayesian Optimization based on Gaussian Processes, which exploit all the x values tried and all the f(x) values obtained so far to pick the next x, predicts human performance and searched locations better. In 6 follow-up controlled experiments over 76 subjects, covering interpolation, extrapolation, and optimization tasks, we further confirm that Gaussian Processes provide a general and unified theoretical account to explain passive and active function learning and search in humans.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">254</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Michel Besserve, Nikos K.

To achieve this goal we analyze the properties of the kernel cross-spectral density operator induced by positive definite kernels on arbitrary input domains. This framework enables us to develop an independence test between time series as well as a similarity measure to compare different types of coupling.

We exploit the remarkable structure of the convex cone of positive definite matrices which allows one to uncover hidden geodesic convexity of objective functions that are nonconvex in the ordinary Euclidean sense. Going even beyond manifold convexity we show how further metric properties of HPD matrices can be exploited to globally optimise several ECD log-likelihoods that are not even geodesic convex. We present key results that help recognise this geometric structure, as well as obtain efficient fixed-point algorithms to optimise the corresponding objective functions.

We propose a nonparametric multi-group membership model for dynamic networks. Our model contains three main components. We model the birth and death of groups with respect to the dynamics of the network structure via a distance dependent Indian Buffet Process. We capture the evolution of individual node group memberships via a Factorial Hidden Markov model. And, we explain the dynamics of the network structure by explicitly modeling the connectivity structure. We demonstrate our model’s capability of identifying the dynamics of latent groups in a number of different types of network data.

As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify theuncertainty' associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical significance as confidence intervals or p-values.  We consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose  an efficient algorithm  for constructing confidence intervals and p-values.  The resulting confidence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power.  Our approach is based on constructing ade-biased' version of regularized M-estimators.

The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called {\em Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso}, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks.

More recently, the framework of copula modeling has gained popularity due to its modular parametrization of joint distributions. Among other properties, copulas provide a recipe for combining flexible models for univariate marginal distributions with parametric families suitable for potentially high dimensional dependence structures. More radically, the extended rank likelihood approach of Hoff (2007) bypasses learning marginal models completely when such information is ancillary to the learning task at hand as in, e.g., standard dimensionality reduction problems or copula parameter estimation. The main idea is to represent data by their observable rank statistics, ignoring any other information from the marginals. Inference is typically done in a Bayesian framework with Gaussian copulas, and it is complicated by the fact this implies sampling within a space where the number of constraints increase quadratically with the number of data points. The result is slow mixing when using off-the-shelf Gibbs sampling.

Previous models suffer from weak interaction between entities or simple linear projection of the vector space. We address these problems by introducing a neural tensor network (NTN) model which allow the entities and relations to interact multiplicatively. Additionally, we observe that such knowledge base models can be further improved by representing each entity as the average of vectors for the words in the entity name, giving an additional dimension of similarity by which entities can share statistical strength. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a partial knowledge base. Our model outperforms previous models and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet and FreeBase with an accuracy of 86.2% and 90.0%, respectively.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">269</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Zheng Wen, Benjamin Van Roy</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/bad5f33780c42f2588878a9d07405083-Paper.pdf">Efficient Exploration and Value Function Generalization in Deterministic Systems</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We consider the problem of reinforcement learning over episodes of a finite-horizon deterministic system  and as a solution propose optimistic constraint propagation (OCP), an algorithm designed to synthesize efficient exploration and value function generalization.

This paper presents an online lookahead search algorithm that alleviates these difficulties by limiting the search to a set of sampled scenarios. The execution of all policies on the sampled scenarios is summarized using a Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT), which is a sparsely sampled belief tree. Our algorithm, named Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT), searches the DESPOT for a policy that optimally balances the size of the policy and the accuracy on its value estimate obtained through sampling. We give an output-sensitive performance bound for all policies derived from the DESPOT, and show that R-DESPOT works well if a small optimal policy exists. We also give an anytime approximation to R-DESPOT. Experiments show strong results, compared with two of the fastest online POMDP algorithms.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">199</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Josip Djolonga, Andreas Krause, Volkan Cevher</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8d34201a5b85900908db6cae92723617-Paper.pdf">High-Dimensional Gaussian Process Bandits</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Many applications in machine learning require optimizing unknown functions defined over a high-dimensional space from noisy samples that are expensive to obtain. We address this notoriously hard challenge, under the assumptions that the function varies only along some low-dimensional subspace and is smooth (i.e., it has a low norm in a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space). In particular, we present the SI-BO algorithm, which leverages recent low-rank matrix recovery techniques to learn the underlying subspace of the unknown function and applies Gaussian Process Upper Confidence sampling for optimization of the function. We carefully calibrate the exploration–exploitation tradeoff by allocating sampling budget to subspace estimation and function optimization, and obtain the first subexponential cumulative regret bounds and convergence rates for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensions under noisy observations.

In all three problems, we provide improved bounds which depend on the “curvature” of a submodular function and improve on the previously known best results for these problems [9, 3, 7, 25] when the function is not too curved – a property which is true of many real-world submodular functions. In the former two problems, we obtain these bounds through a generic black-box transformation (which can potentially work for any algorithm), while in the case of submodular minimization, we propose a framework of algorithms which depend on choosing an appropriate surrogate for the submodular function. In all these cases, we provide almost matching lower bounds. While improved curvature-dependent bounds were shown for monotone submodular maximization [4, 27], the existence of similar improved bounds for the aforementioned problems has been open. We resolve this question in this paper by showing that the same notion of curvature provides these improved results. Empirical experiments add further support to our claims.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">255</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Marco Cuturi</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/af21d0c97db2e27e13572cbf59eb343d-Paper.pdf">Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Optimal transportation distances are a fundamental family of parameterized distances for histograms in the probability simplex. Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost is prohibitive whenever the histograms' dimension exceeds a few hundreds. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers.

While this data is often either proprietary or sensitive, aggregated data, notably row and column marginals, is often viewed as much less sensitive, and may be furnished for analysis. Here, we investigate how these data can be exploited to make inferences about the underlying matrix H. Instead of assuming a generative model for H, we view the input marginals as constraints on the dataspace of possible realizations of H and compute the probability density function of particular entries H(i,j) of interest. We do this, for all the cells of H simultaneously, without generating realizations but rather via implicitly sampling the datasets that satisfy the input marginals. The end result is an efficient algorithm with running time equal to the time required by standard sampling techniques to generate a single dataset from the same dataspace. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and the efficacy of our framework in multiple settings.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">271</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Sheeraz Ahmad, He Huang, Angela J.

Understanding the computational basis of natural active sensing is important both for advancing brain sciences and for developing more powerful artificial systems. Recently, a goal-directed, context-sensitive, Bayesian control strategy for active sensing, termed C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller), was proposed (Ahmad &amp; Yu, 2013). In contrast to previously proposed algorithms for human active vision, which tend to optimize abstract statistical objectives and therefore cannot adapt to changing behavioral context or task goals, C-DAC directly minimizes behavioral costs and thus, automatically adapts itself to different task conditions. However, C-DAC is limited as a model of human active sensing, given its computational/representational requirements, especially for more complex, real-world situations. Here, we propose a myopic approximation to C-DAC, which also takes behavioral costs into account, but achieves a significant reduction in complexity by looking only one step ahead. We also present data from a human active visual search experiment, and compare the performance of the various models against human behavior. We find that C-DAC and its myopic variant both achieve better fit to human data than Infomax (Butko &amp; Movellan, 2010), which maximizes expected cumulative future information gain. In summary, this work provides novel experimental results that differentiate theoretical models for human active sensing, as well as a novel active sensing algorithm that retains the context-sensitivity of the optimal controller while achieving significant computational savings.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">289</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Rohit Babbar, Ioannis Partalas, Eric Gaussier, Massih R.

We develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until a desired loss function cannot be decreased any further.  SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations.  We prove that SWAP can be easily used as a wrapper around standard sparse recovery algorithms for improved performance.

The usual setting is that data are collected sequentially  from trajectories of some dynamical system operation.   In quite a few modern scientific modeling tasks, however, it turns out that  reliable sequential data are rather difficult to gather, whereas out-of-order snapshots are much easier to obtain. Examples include the modeling of galaxies, chronic diseases such Alzheimer's, or certain biological processes.  Existing methods for learning dynamic model from non-sequence data are mostly based on Expectation-Maximization, which involves non-convex optimization and is thus hard to analyze.  Inspired by recent advances in spectral learning methods, we propose to study this problem  from a different perspective: moment matching and spectral decomposition. Under that framework,  we identify reasonable assumptions on the generative process of non-sequence data,  and propose learning algorithms based on the tensor decomposition method  \cite{anandkumar2012tensor} to \textit{provably} recover first-order Markov models and hidden Markov models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal guarantee on learning from non-sequence data.

We introduce a novel parametric method of merging superpixels by modeling mixture of Weibull distributions on similarity distance statistics, then taking the normalized number of proto-objects following partitioning as our estimate of clutter perception. We validated this model using a new $\text{90}-$image dataset of realistic scenes rank ordered by human raters for clutter, and showed that our method not only predicted clutter extremely well (Spearman's $\rho = 0.81$, $p &lt; 0.05$), but also outperformed all existing clutter perception models and even a behavioral object segmentation ground truth.

Empirical work has shown that some models can be sampled effectively by going Hogwild'' and simply running Gibbs updates in parallel with only periodic global communication, but the successes and limitations of such a strategy are not well understood.  As a step towards such an understanding, we study the Hogwild Gibbs sampling strategy in the context of Gaussian distributions. We develop a framework which provides convergence conditions and error bounds along with simple proofs and connections to methods in numerical linear algebra.  In particular, we show that if the Gaussian precision matrix is generalized diagonally dominant, then any Hogwild Gibbs sampler, with any update schedule or allocation of variables to processors, yields a stable sampling process with the correct sample mean.

This is challenging because the criterion defining a good trajectory varies with users, tasks and environments.  In this paper, we propose a co-active online  learning framework for teaching robots the preferences of its users for object  manipulation tasks. The key novelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user: the human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training data, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly improve over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that this  co-active preference feedback can be more easily elicited from the user than demonstrations of optimal trajectories, which are often challenging and non-intuitive to provide on high degrees of freedom manipulators. Nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds of our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms. We also formulate a score function to capture the contextual information and demonstrate the generalizability of our algorithm on a variety of household tasks, for whom, the preferences were not only influenced by the object being manipulated but also by the surrounding environment.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">261</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Aaron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Benjamin Schrauwen</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/b3ba8f1bee1238a2f37603d90b58898d-Paper.pdf">Deep content-based music recommendation</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally.

In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal.

We find that a baseline model, one that simply computes a linear weighted sum of ventral and dorsal responses to short action “snippets”, produces surprisingly good fits to the neural data. Interestingly, even using inputs from a single stream, both actor-invariance and action-invariance can be produced simply by having different linear weights.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">296</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Michael C Hughes, Erik Sudderth</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/d490d7b4576290fa60eb31b5fc917ad1-Paper.pdf">Memoized Online Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Variational inference algorithms provide the most effective framework for large-scale training  of Bayesian nonparametric models. Stochastic online approaches are promising, but are sensitive to the chosen learning rate and often converge to poor local optima.  We present a new algorithm, memoized online variational inference, which scales to very large (yet finite) datasets while avoiding the complexities of stochastic gradient.  Our algorithm maintains finite-dimensional sufficient statistics from batches of the full dataset, requiring some additional memory but still scaling to millions of examples.  Exploiting nested families of variational bounds for infinite nonparametric models, we develop principled birth and merge moves allowing non-local optimization.  Births adaptively add components to the model to escape local optima, while merges remove redundancy and improve speed.  Using Dirichlet process mixture models for image clustering and denoising, we demonstrate major improvements in robustness and accuracy.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">294</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Mahito Sugiyama, Karsten Borgwardt</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/d296c101daa88a51f6ca8cfc1ac79b50-Paper.pdf">Rapid Distance-Based Outlier Detection via Sampling</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Distance-based approaches to outlier detection are popular in data mining, as they do not require to model the underlying probability distribution, which is particularly challenging for high-dimensional data.

The present study proposes a novel mechanism to achieve this. We consider two reciprocally connected networks, mimicking the integration of heading direction information between the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and the ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas. Each network serves as a local estimator and receives an independent cue, either the visual or the vestibular, as direct input for the external stimulus. We find that positive reciprocal interactions can improve the decoding accuracy of each individual network as if it implements Bayesian inference from two cues. Our model successfully explains the experimental finding that both MSTd and VIP achieve Bayesian multisensory integration, though each of them only receives a single cue as direct external input. Our result suggests that the brain may implement optimal information integration distributively at each local estimator through the reciprocal connections between cortical regions.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">286</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Liam C MacDermed, Charles L Isbell</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/c9e1074f5b3f9fc8ea15d152add07294-Paper.pdf">Point Based Value Iteration with Optimal Belief Compression for Dec-POMDPs</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">This paper presents four major results towards solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision problems (DecPOMDPs) culminating in an algorithm that outperforms all existing algorithms on all but one standard infinite-horizon benchmark problems.

Current methods typically fail to find the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly  recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using  probabilistic predictions generated by visual classifiers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children.  We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a significant advantage results from combining visual classifiers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">292</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Arash Amini, Xuanlong Nguyen</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/d10ec7c16cbe9de8fbb1c42787c3ec26-Paper.pdf">Bayesian inference as iterated random functions with  applications to sequential inference in graphical models</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose a general formalism of iterated random functions with semigroup property, under which exact and approximate Bayesian posterior updates can be viewed as specific instances.

Discrete variables are represented by coupled Winner-Take-All (WTA) networks, and their values are encoded in localized patterns of oscillations that are learned by the recurrent weights in these networks. Constraints over the variables are encoded in the network connectivity. Although there are no sources of noise, the network can escape from local optima in its search for solutions that satisfy all constraints by modifying the effective network connectivity through oscillations. If there is no solution that satisfies all constraints, the network state changes in a pseudo-random manner and its trajectory approximates a sampling procedure that selects a variable assignment with a probability that increases with the fraction of constraints satisfied by this assignment. External evidence, or input to the network, can force variables to specific values. When new inputs are applied, the network re-evaluates the entire set of variables in its search for the states that satisfy the maximum number of constraints, while being consistent with the external input. Our results demonstrate that the proposed network architecture can perform a deterministic search for the optimal solution to problems with non-convex cost functions. The network is inspired by canonical microcircuit models of the cortex and suggests possible dynamical mechanisms to solve constraint satisfaction problems that can be present in biological networks, or implemented in neuromorphic electronic circuits.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">301</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Yuhong Guo</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/d86ea612dec96096c5e0fcc8dd42ab6d-Paper.pdf">Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Principal component analysis (PCA), a well-established technique for data analysis and processing, provides a convenient form of dimensionality reduction that is effective for cleaning small Gaussian noises presented in the data. However, the applicability of standard principal component analysis in real scenarios is limited by its sensitivity to large errors. In this paper, we tackle the challenge problem of recovering data corrupted with errors of high magnitude by developing a novel robust transfer principal component analysis method. Our method is based on the assumption that useful information for the recovery of a corrupted data matrix can be gained from an uncorrupted related data matrix. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the data recovery problem as a joint robust principal component analysis problem on the two data matrices, with shared common principal components across matrices and individual principal components speciﬁc to each data matrix. The formulated optimization problem is a minimization problem over a convex objective function but with non-convex rank constraints. We develop an efﬁcient proximal projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem with convergence guarantees. Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">196</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Dahua Lin</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/8c19f571e251e61cb8dd3612f26d5ecf-Paper.pdf">Online Learning of Nonparametric Mixture Models via Sequential Variational Approximation</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Reliance on computationally expensive algorithms for inference has been limiting the use of Bayesian nonparametric models in large scale applications.

Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the fly when needed.

Prior work has focused almost exclusively on factored states but not factored actions, and on value iteration (VI) compared to policy iteration (PI). Our ﬁrst contribution is a novel method for symbolic policy backups via the application of constraints, which is used to yield a new efﬁcient symbolic imple- mentation of modiﬁed PI (MPI) for factored action spaces. While this approach improves scalability in some cases, naive handling of policy constraints comes with its own scalability issues. This leads to our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent al- gorithm lying between VI and MPI. The core idea is a symbolic procedure that applies policy constraints only when they reduce the space and time complexity of the update, and otherwise performs full Bellman backups, thus automatically adjusting the backup per state. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over the state-of-the-art.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">273</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Carlos J Becker, Christos M Christoudias, Pascal Fua</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/c042f4db68f23406c6cecf84a7ebb0fe-Paper.pdf">Non-Linear Domain Adaptation with Boosting</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">A common assumption in machine vision is that the training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution. However, there are many problems when this assumption is grossly violated, as in bio-medical applications where different acquisitions can generate drastic variations in the appearance of the data due to changing experimental conditions. This problem is accentuated with 3D data, for which annotation is very time-consuming, limiting the amount of data that can be labeled in new acquisitions for training. In this paper we present a multi-task learning algorithm for domain adaptation based on boosting. Unlike previous approaches that learn task-specific decision boundaries, our method learns a single decision boundary in a shared feature space, common to all tasks. We use the boosting-trick to learn a non-linear mapping of the observations in each task, with no need for specific a-priori knowledge of its global analytical form. This yields a more parameter-free domain adaptation approach that successfully leverages learning on new tasks where labeled data is scarce. We evaluate our approach on two challenging bio-medical datasets and achieve a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">282</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Fang Zhao, Yongzhen Huang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/c4851e8e264415c4094e4e85b0baa7cc-Paper.pdf">Relevance Topic Model for Unstructured Social Group Activity Recognition</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Unstructured social group activity recognition in web videos is a challenging task due to 1) the semantic gap between class labels and low-level visual features and 2) the lack of labeled training data.

In our approach, sparse Bayesian learning is incorporated into an undirected topic model (i.e., Replicated Softmax) to discover topics which are relevant to video classes and suitable for prediction. Rectified linear units are utilized to increase the expressive power of topics so as to explain better video data containing complex contents and make variational inference tractable for the proposed model.

We propose a simple and scalable new approach to learning word embeddings based on training log-bilinear models with noise-contrastive estimation.  Our approach is simpler, faster, and produces better results than the current state-of-the art method of Mikolov et al. (2013a). We achieve results comparable to the best ones reported, which were obtained on a cluster, using four times less data and more than an order of magnitude less computing time.

One of the salient features of our analysis is that the problems studied here are easier when the dimension of $x_i$ is large; in other words, prediction becomes easier when more context is provided. The proposed methodology is a variant of principal component regression (PCR). Our rigorous analysis sheds new light on PCR.

We identify conditions for the output of GMM to be unique, and identify a general class of consistent and inconsistent breakings. We then show by theory and experiments that our algorithms run significantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while achieving competitive statistical efficiency.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">308</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Naiyan Wang, Dit-Yan Yeung</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/dc6a6489640ca02b0d42dabeb8e46bb7-Paper.pdf">Learning a Deep Compact Image Representation for Visual Tracking</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">In this paper, we study the challenging problem of tracking the trajectory of a moving object in a video with possibly very complex background.  In contrast to most existing trackers which only learn the appearance of the tracked object online, we take a different approach, inspired by recent advances in deep learning architectures, by putting more emphasis on the (unsupervised) feature learning problem.  Specifically, by using auxiliary natural images, we train a stacked denoising autoencoder offline to learn generic image features that are more robust against variations.  This is then followed by knowledge transfer from offline training to the online tracking process.  Online tracking involves a classification neural network which is constructed from the encoder part of the trained autoencoder as a feature extractor and an additional classification layer.  Both the feature extractor and the classifier can be further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object.  Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on some challenging benchmark video sequences shows that our deep learning tracker is very efficient as well as more accurate.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">307</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Remi Gribonval, Pierre Machart</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/dc58e3a306451c9d670adcd37004f48f-Paper.pdf">Reconciling "priors" &amp; "priors" without prejudice?</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">There are two major routes to address linear inverse problems. Whereas regularization-based approaches build estimators as solutions of penalized regression optimization problems, Bayesian estimators rely on the posterior distribution of the unknown, given some assumed family of priors. While these may seem radically different approaches, recent results have shown that, in the context of additive white Gaussian denoising, the Bayesian conditional mean estimator is always the solution of a penalized regression problem. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we extend the additive white Gaussian denoising results to general linear inverse problems with colored Gaussian noise. Second, we characterize conditions under which the penalty function associated to the conditional mean estimator can satisfy certain popular properties such as convexity, separability, and smoothness. This sheds light on some tradeoff between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy in sparse regularization, and draws some connections between Bayesian estimation and proximal optimization.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">333</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Yu-Xiang Wang, Huan Xu, Chenlei Leng</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f033ab37c30201f73f142449d037028d-Paper.pdf">Provable Subspace Clustering: When LRR meets SSC</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) and Low-Rank Representation (LRR) are both considered as the state-of-the-art methods for {\em subspace clustering}. The two methods are fundamentally similar in that both are convex optimizations exploiting the intuition of Self-Expressiveness''. The main difference is that SSC minimizes the vector $\ell_1$ norm of the representation matrix to induce sparsity while LRR minimizes nuclear norm (aka trace norm) to promote a low-rank structure. Because the representation matrix is often simultaneously sparse and low-rank,  we propose a new algorithm, termed Low-Rank Sparse Subspace Clustering (LRSSC), by combining SSC and LRR, and develops theoretical guarantees of when the algorithm succeeds.

In particular, there may be certain time intervals exhibiting rapid changes and others in which changes are slow. If such locally adaptive smoothness is not accounted for, one can obtain misleading inferences and predictions, with over-smoothing across erratic time intervals and under-smoothing across times exhibiting slow variation. This can lead to miscalibration of predictive intervals, which can be substantially too narrow or wide depending on the time. We propose a continuous multivariate stochastic process for time series having locally varying smoothness in both the mean and covariance matrix. This process is constructed utilizing latent dictionary functions in time, which are given nested Gaussian process priors and linearly related to the observed data through a sparse mapping. Using a differential equation representation, we bypass usual computational bottlenecks in obtaining MCMC and online algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference.

Our approach is based on extending multi-task Gaussian processes to the framework of Bayesian optimization. We show that this method significantly speeds up the optimization process when compared to the standard single-task approach. We further propose a straightforward extension of our algorithm in order to jointly minimize the average error across multiple tasks and demonstrate how this can be used to greatly speed up $k$-fold cross-validation. Lastly, our most significant contribution is an adaptation of a recently proposed acquisition function, entropy search, to the cost-sensitive and multi-task settings.

In these logistic regression problems, each training example has a bias term determined by the current set of messages.

The constraint that the estimated Bayesian network structure  must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG) makes the problem challenging because of the huge search space of network structures. Most previous methods were based on a two-stage approach that prunes the search space in the first stage and then searches for a network structure that satisfies the DAG constraint in the second stage. Although this approach is effective in a low-dimensional setting, it is difficult to ensure that the correct network structure is not pruned in the first stage in a high-dimensional setting.  In this paper, we propose a single-stage method, called A* lasso, that recovers the optimal  sparse Bayesian network structure by solving a single optimization problem with A* search algorithm that uses lasso in its scoring system. Our approach substantially improves the computational efficiency of the well-known exact methods  based on dynamic programming. We also present a heuristic scheme that further improves the efficiency of A* lasso without significantly compromising the quality of solutions and   demonstrate this on benchmark Bayesian networks and real data.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">342</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Botond Cseke, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f4be00279ee2e0a53eafdaa94a151e2c-Paper.pdf">Approximate inference in latent Gaussian-Markov models from continuous time observations</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose an approximate inference algorithm for continuous time Gaussian-Markov process models with both discrete and continuous time likelihoods.

Variance related risk measures are among the most common risk-sensitive criteria in finance and operations research. However, optimizing many such criteria is known to be a hard problem. In this paper, we consider both discounted and average reward Markov decision processes. For each formulation, we first define a measure of variability for a policy, which in turn gives us a set of risk-sensitive criteria to optimize. For each of these criteria, we derive a formula for computing its gradient. We then devise actor-critic algorithms for estimating the gradient and updating the policy parameters in the ascent direction. We establish the convergence of our algorithms to locally risk-sensitive optimal policies.

In this paper, we address this problem by constructing a rapidly mixing Markov chain, from which we can acquire a sample from the given DPP in sub-cubic time.  In addition, we show that this framework can be extended to sampling from cardinality-constrained DPPs.

In this paper, we study the scenario where the expected gain is initially unknown and it is learned by interacting repeatedly with the optimized function. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving our problem and prove that its expected cumulative regret increases logarithmically with time. Our regret bound captures the inherent property of submodular maximization, earlier mistakes are more costly than later ones. We refer to our approach as Optimistic Adaptive Submodular Maximization (OASM) because it trades off exploration and exploitation based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle.

We rely on a large corpus of imaging studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to find commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus. The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus.

In this paper, we introduce a generic validation procedure for differentially private machine learning algorithms that apply when a certain stability condition holds on the training algorithm and the validation performance metric. The training data size and the privacy budget used for training in our procedure is independent of the number of parameter values searched over.

This is an important problem because firing rates are one of the most important measures of network activity, in both the study of neural computation and neural network dynamics. However, it is a difficult problem, because the spiking mechanism of individual neurons is highly non-linear, and these individual neurons interact strongly through connectivity. We develop a new technique for calculating firing rates in optimal balanced networks. These are particularly interesting networks because they provide an optimal spike-based signal representation while producing cortex-like spiking activity through a dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition. We can calculate firing rates by treating balanced network dynamics as an algorithm for optimizing signal representation. We identify this algorithm and then calculate firing rates by finding the solution to the algorithm. Our firing rate calculation relates network firing rates directly to network input, connectivity and function.

For spiking neurons, the entropy rate places an upper bound on the rate at which the spike train can convey stimulus information, and a large literature has focused on the problem of estimating entropy rate from spike train data.  Here we present Bayes Least Squares and Empirical Bayesian entropy rate estimators for binary spike trains using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) priors.  Our estimator leverages the fact that the entropy rate of an ergodic Markov Chain with known transition probabilities can be calculated analytically, and many stochastic processes that are non-Markovian can still be well approximated by Markov processes of sufficient depth.  Choosing an appropriate depth of Markov model presents challenges due to possibly long time dependencies and short data sequences: a deeper model can better account for long time-dependencies, but is more difficult to infer from limited data. Our approach mitigates this difficulty by using a hierarchical prior to share statistical power across Markov chains of different depths.

In the future such abstractions might enable nanoscale devices that can sense and control the world at a molecular scale.  Just as in macroscale robotics, it is critical that such devices can learn about their environment and reason under uncertainty. At this small scale, systems are typically modeled as chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop a procedure that can take arbitrary probabilistic graphical models, represented as factor graphs over discrete random variables, and compile them into chemical reaction networks that implement inference.  In particular, we show that marginalization based on sum-product message passing can be implemented in terms of reactions between chemical species whose concentrations represent probabilities.  We show algebraically that the steady state concentration of these species correspond to the marginal distributions of the random variables in the graph and validate the results in simulations.  As with standard sum-product inference, this procedure yields exact results for tree-structured graphs, and approximate solutions for loopy graphs.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">325</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Ulrike Von Luxburg, Morteza Alamgir</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/eae27d77ca20db309e056e3d2dcd7d69-Paper.pdf">Density estimation from unweighted k-nearest neighbor graphs: a roadmap</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Consider an unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph   on n points that have been sampled i.i.d. from some unknown density p on R^d.

In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as {\bf Mixed Optimization}, which allows to access  both a stochastic oracle  and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to significantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle.

However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models.  Significant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost.  Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to fine-tune feature extraction to each input at run-time.  We address the key challenge of learning to control fine-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting non-homogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efficient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input.  We demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is simultaneously 4$\times$ faster while using only a small fraction of possible features, with similar results on an OCR task.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">339</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Nima Taghipour, Jesse Davis, Hendrik Blockeel</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f387624df552cea2f369918c5e1e12bc-Paper.pdf">First-order Decomposition Trees</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Lifting attempts to speedup probabilistic inference by exploiting symmetries in the model. Exact lifted inference methods, like their propositional counterparts, work by recursively decomposing the model and the problem. In the propositional case, there exist formal structures, such as decomposition trees (dtrees), that represent such a decomposition and allow us to determine the complexity of inference a priori. However, there is currently no equivalent structure nor analogous complexity results for lifted inference. In this paper, we introduce FO-dtrees, which upgrade propositional dtrees to the first-order level. We show how these trees can characterize a lifted inference solution for a probabilistic logical model (in terms of a sequence of lifted operations), and make a theoretical analysis of the complexity of lifted inference in terms of the novel notion of lifted width for the tree.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">279</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Chris Hinrichs, Vamsi K Ithapu, Qinyuan Sun, Sterling C Johnson, Vikas Singh</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/c3c59e5f8b3e9753913f4d435b53c308-Paper.pdf">Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Multiple hypothesis testing is a significant problem in nearly all neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known Bonferroni correction method, while being simple to implement, is quite conservative, and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact, non parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given α threshold, but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive. In this paper, we observe that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating the columns of a very large matrix P. By analyzing the spectrum of this matrix, under certain conditions, we see that P has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly sub–sampled — on the order of 0.5% — matrix completion methods. Thus, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which offers a large speedup, without sacrificing the fidelity of the estimated FWER. Our valuations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a computational speedup factor of roughly 50× can be achieved while recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show that the estimated α threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is stable.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">340</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Amin Karbasi, Amir Hesam Salavati, Amin Shokrollahi, Lav R.

Although these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons that compute noiselessly, in contrast to the highly variable neurons in hippocampus and olfactory cortex.  Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as the internal noise level is below a specified threshold, the error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show that internal noise actually improves the performance of the recall phase. Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis.

If the conditional expectations in the DP recursions are estimated via kernel regression, however, the historical sample paths enter the solution procedure directly as they determine the evaluation points of the cost-to-go functions. The resulting data-driven DP scheme is asymptotically consistent and admits efficient computational solution when combined with parametric value function approximations. If training data is sparse, however, the estimated cost-to-go functions display a high variability and an optimistic bias, while the corresponding control policies perform poorly in out-of-sample tests. To mitigate these small sample effects, we propose a robust data-driven DP scheme, which replaces the expectations in the DP recursions with worst-case expectations over a set of distributions close to the best estimate. We show that the arising min-max problems in the DP recursions reduce to tractable conic programs. We also demonstrate that this robust algorithm dominates state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in out-of-sample tests across several application domains.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">344</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f64eac11f2cd8f0efa196f8ad173178e-Paper.pdf">Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">In the last decade, policy gradient methods have significantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement--learning field. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identification of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efficient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly influenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step--size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second--order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simplified version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear--quadratic regulator problem.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">354</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Nguyen Viet Cuong, Wee Sun Lee, Nan Ye, Kian Ming A Chai, Hai Leong Chieu</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/fb89705ae6d743bf1e848c206e16a1d7-Paper.pdf">Active Learning for Probabilistic Hypotheses Using the Maximum Gibbs Error Criterion</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We introduce a new objective function for pool-based Bayesian active learning with probabilistic hypotheses. This objective function, called the policy Gibbs error, is the expected error rate of a random classifier drawn from the prior distribution on the examples adaptively selected by the active learning policy. Exact maximization of the policy Gibbs error is hard, so we propose a greedy strategy that maximizes the Gibbs error at each iteration, where the Gibbs error on an instance is the expected error of a random classifier selected from the posterior label distribution on that instance. We apply this maximum Gibbs error criterion to three active learning scenarios: non-adaptive, adaptive, and batch active learning. In each scenario, we prove that the criterion achieves near-maximal policy Gibbs error when constrained to a fixed budget. For practical implementations, we provide approximations to the maximum Gibbs error criterion for Bayesian conditional random fields and transductive Naive Bayes. Our experimental results on a named entity recognition task and a text classification task show that the maximum Gibbs error criterion is an effective active learning criterion for noisy models.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">346</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Christian Szegedy, Alexander Toshev, Dumitru Erhan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f7cade80b7cc92b991cf4d2806d6bd78-Paper.pdf">Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance on the task of whole image classification.

We extend the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm used in CS to the case of blind calibration. In the calibration-AMP, both the gains on the sensors and the elements of the signals are treated as unknowns. Our algorithm is also applicable to settings in which the sensors distort the measurements in other ways than multiplication by a gain, unlike previously suggested blind calibration algorithms based on convex relaxations.

Instead, most vision tasks are approached via complex bottom-up processing pipelines. Here we show that it is possible to write short, simple probabilistic graphics programs that define flexible generative models and to automatically invert them to interpret real-world images. Generative probabilistic graphics programs consist of a stochastic scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood model linking the renderer's output and the data, and latent variables that adjust the fidelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood model. Representations and algorithms from computer graphics, originally designed to produce high-quality images, are instead used as the deterministic backbone for highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian computation, and depends only on general-purpose, automatic inference techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and adversarially obscured alphanumeric characters, and inferring 3D road models from vehicle-mounted camera images. Each of the probabilistic graphics programs we present relies on under 20 lines of probabilistic code, and supports accurate, approximately Bayesian inferences about ambiguous real-world images.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">348</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Corinna Cortes, Marius Kloft, Mehryar Mohri</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f91e24dfe80012e2a7984afa4480a6d6-Paper.pdf">Learning Kernels Using Local Rademacher Complexity</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We use the notion of local Rademacher complexity to design new algorithms for learning kernels.

It was recently shown that BP converges to the correct MAP assignment for a class of loopy GMs with the following common feature: the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation to the MAP problem is tight (has no integrality gap). Unfortunately, tightness of the LP relaxation does not, in general, guarantee convergence and correctness of the BP algorithm. The failure of BP in such cases motivates reverse engineering a solution – namely, given a tight LP, can we design a ‘good’ BP algorithm.  In this paper, we design a BP algorithm for the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem over general graphs. We prove that the algorithm converges to the correct optimum if the respective LP relaxation, which may include inequalities associated with non-intersecting odd-sized cycles, is tight. The most significant part of our approach is the introduction of a novel graph transformation designed to force convergence of BP. Our theoretical result suggests an efficient BP-based heuristic for the MWM problem, which consists of making sequential, “cutting plane”, modifications to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this heuristic performs as well as traditional cutting-plane algorithms using LP solvers on MWM problems.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">350</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A Efros</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f9b902fc3289af4dd08de5d1de54f68f-Paper.pdf">Mid-level Visual Element Discovery as Discriminative Mode Seeking</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the level of complexity higher than typical visual words", but lower than full-blown semantic objects.

However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difficult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data.

We use significantly weaker assumptions than previous work---for instance, we allow large jumps in the asset price---and show that the Black-Scholes hedging strategy is near-optimal for the Investor even in this non-stochastic framework."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">352</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Roger B Grosse, Chris J Maddison, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/fb60d411a5c5b72b2e7d3527cfc84fd0-Paper.pdf">Annealing between distributions by averaging moments</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Many powerful Monte Carlo techniques for estimating partition functions, such as annealed importance sampling (AIS), are based on sampling from a sequence of intermediate distributions which interpolate between a tractable initial distribution and an intractable target distribution. The near-universal practice is to use geometric averages of the initial and target distributions, but alternative paths can perform substantially better. We present a novel sequence of intermediate distributions for exponential families: averaging the moments of the initial and target distributions. We derive an asymptotically optimal piecewise linear schedule for the moments path and show that it performs at least as well as geometric averages with a linear schedule.  Moment averaging performs well empirically at estimating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which form the building blocks of many deep learning models, including Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">347</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Jeffrey W Miller, Matthew T Harrison</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f7e6c85504ce6e82442c770f7c8606f0-Paper.pdf">A simple example of Dirichlet process mixture inconsistency for the number of components</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">For data assumed to come from a finite mixture with an unknown number of components, it has become common to use Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) not only for density estimation, but also for inferences about the number of components. The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the number of components occurring so far --- that is, the posterior on the number of clusters in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent --- it does not converge to the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary demonstration of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a mixture" with one standard normal component. Further, we find that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster goes to 0."</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">357</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Beomjoon Kim, Amir-massoud Farahmand, Joelle Pineau, Doina Precup</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/fd5c905bcd8c3348ad1b35d7231ee2b1-Paper.pdf">Learning from Limited Demonstrations</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We propose an approach to learning from demonstration (LfD) which leverages expert data, even if the expert examples are very few or inaccurate.

The complex interplay between the task and the visual stimulus is believed to determine human eye movements, yet it is not fully understood. This has precluded the development of reliable dynamic eye movement prediction systems. Our work makes three contributions towards addressing this problem. First, we complement one of the largest and most challenging static computer vision datasets, VOC 2012 Actions, with human eye movement annotations collected under the task constraints of action and context recognition. Our dataset is unique among eyetracking datasets for still images in terms of its large scale (over 1 million fixations, 9157 images), task control and action from a single image emphasis. Second, we introduce models to automatically discover areas of interest (AOI) and introduce novel dynamic consistency metrics, based on them. Our method can automatically determine the number and spatial support of the AOIs, in addition to their locations. Based on such encodings, we show that, on unconstrained read-world stimuli, task instructions have significant influence on visual behavior. Finally, we leverage our large scale dataset in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques and computer vision features, to introduce novel dynamic eye movement prediction methods which learn task-sensitive reward functions from eye movement data and efficiently integrate these rewards to plan future saccades based on inverse optimal control. We show that the propose methodology achieves state of the art scanpath modeling results.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">358</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Gunnar Kedenburg, Raphael Fonteneau, Remi Munos</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/fe709c654eac84d5239d1a12a4f71877-Paper.pdf">Aggregating Optimistic Planning Trees for Solving Markov Decision Processes</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">This paper addresses the problem of online planning in Markov Decision Processes using only a generative model. We propose a new algorithm which is based on the construction of a forest of single successor state planning trees. For every explored state-action, such a tree contains exactly one successor state, drawn from the generative model. The trees are built using a planning algorithm which follows the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle, in assuming the most favorable outcome in the absence of further information. In the decision making step of the algorithm, the individual trees are combined.

Estimating the entropy of a discrete distribution from samples is an important and difficult problem that has received considerable   attention in statistics and theoretical neuroscience.  However,  neural responses have characteristic statistical structure that   generic entropy estimators fail to exploit.  For example, existing  Bayesian entropy estimators make the naive assumption that all spike   words are equally likely a priori, which makes for an  inefficient allocation of prior probability mass in cases where   spikes are sparse.  Here we develop Bayesian estimators for the  entropy of binary spike trains using priors designed to flexibly   exploit the statistical structure of simultaneously-recorded spike  responses.  We define two prior distributions over spike words using   mixtures of Dirichlet distributions centered on simple parametric  models.  The parametric model captures high-level statistical   features of the data, such as the average spike count in a spike  word, which allows the posterior over entropy to concentrate more   rapidly than with standard estimators (e.g., in cases where the  probability of spiking differs strongly from 0.5). Conversely, the   Dirichlet distributions assign prior mass to distributions far from  the parametric model, ensuring consistent estimates for arbitrary   distributions.  We devise a compact representation of the data and  prior that allow for computationally efficient implementations of   Bayesian least squares and empirical Bayes entropy estimators with  large numbers of neurons.  We apply these estimators to simulated   and real neural data and show that they substantially outperform  traditional methods.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">356</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Leonid Boytsov, Bilegsaikhan Naidan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/fc8001f834f6a5f0561080d134d53d29-Paper.pdf">Learning to Prune in Metric and Non-Metric Spaces</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Our focus is on approximate nearest neighbor retrieval in metric and non-metric spaces.

Conditions on spaces where the VP-tree is applicable are discussed. The VP-tree with a learned pruner is compared against the recently proposed state-of-the-art approaches: the bbtree, the multi-probe locality sensitive hashing (LSH), and permutation methods.

Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">257</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Khaled S Refaat, Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/b056eb1587586b71e2da9acfe4fbd19e-Paper.pdf">EDML for Learning Parameters in Directed and Undirected Graphical Models</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">EDML is a recently proposed algorithm for learning parameters in Bayesian networks.  It was originally derived in terms of approximate inference on a meta-network, which underlies the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation.  While this initial derivation helped discover EDML in the first place and provided a concrete context for identifying some of its properties (e.g., in contrast to EM), the formal setting was somewhat tedious in the number of concepts it drew on.  In this paper, we propose a greatly simplified perspective on EDML, which casts it as a general approach to continuous optimization. The new perspective has several advantages. First, it makes immediate some results that were non-trivial to prove initially. Second, it facilitates the design of EDML algorithms for new graphical models, leading to a new algorithm for learning parameters in Markov networks.  We derive this algorithm in this paper, and show, empirically, that it can sometimes learn better estimates from complete data, several times faster than commonly used optimization methods, such as conjugate gradient and L-BFGS.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">64</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Marcus Rohrbach, Sandra Ebert, Bernt Schiele</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/3295c76acbf4caaed33c36b1b5fc2cb1-Paper.pdf">Transfer Learning in a Transductive Setting</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Category models for objects or activities typically rely on supervised learning requiring sufficiently large training sets. Transferring knowledge from known categories to novel classes with no or only a few labels however is far less researched even though it is a common scenario. In this work, we extend transfer learning with semi-supervised learning to exploit unlabeled instances of (novel) categories with no or only a few labeled instances. Our proposed approach Propagated Semantic Transfer combines three main ingredients. First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expert-specified information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More specifically we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm - so far only used for semi-supervised learning - to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation. We evaluate our approach on three challenging datasets in two different applications, namely on Animals with Attributes and ImageNet for image classification and on MPII Composites for activity recognition. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transfer and semi-supervised approaches on all datasets.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">314</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Gilles Louppe, Louis Wehenkel, Antonio Sutera, Pierre Geurts</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/e3796ae838835da0b6f6ea37bcf8bcb7-Paper.pdf">Understanding variable importances in forests of randomized trees</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">Despite growing interest and practical use in various scientific areas, variable importances derived from tree-based ensemble methods are not well understood from a theoretical point of view. In this work we characterize the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) variable importances as measured by an ensemble of totally randomized trees in asymptotic sample and ensemble size conditions. We derive a three-level decomposition of the  information jointly provided by all input variables about the output in terms of i) the MDI importance of each input variable, ii) the degree of interaction of a given input variable with the other input variables, iii) the different interaction terms of a given degree. We then show that this MDI importance of a variable is equal to zero if and only if the variable is irrelevant and that the MDI importance of a relevant variable is invariant with respect to the removal or the addition of irrelevant variables. We illustrate these properties on a simple example and discuss how they may change in the case of  non-totally randomized trees such as Random Forests and Extra-Trees.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">236</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/a223c6b3710f85df22e9377d6c4f7553-Paper.pdf">Model Selection for High-Dimensional Regression under the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">In the high-dimensional regression model a response variable is linearly related to $p$ covariates,  but the sample size $n$ is smaller than $p$. We assume that only a small subset of covariates is `active'  (i.e., the corresponding coefficients are non-zero), and consider the model-selection problem of identifying  the active covariates.  A popular approach is to estimate the regression coefficients through the Lasso ($\ell_1$-regularized least squares).  This is known to correctly identify the active set only if the irrelevant covariates are roughly orthogonal to the relevant ones, as quantified through the so called `irrepresentability' condition. In this paper we study the `Gauss-Lasso' selector, a simple two-stage method that first solves the Lasso, and then performs ordinary least squares restricted to the Lasso active set.   We formulate `generalized irrepresentability condition' (GIC), an assumption that is substantially weaker than  irrepresentability. We prove that, under GIC, the Gauss-Lasso correctly recovers the active set.</span></div></p><p id="section"><div id="pid">Paperid:<span id="pid">334</span></div><div id="author">Authors:<span id="author">Sasha Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2013/file/f0dd4a99fba6075a9494772b58f95280-Paper.pdf">Optimization, Learning, and Games with Predictable Sequences</a></div><div id="abs">Abstract: <span id="abs">We provide several applications of Optimistic Mirror Descent, an online learning algorithm based on the idea of predictable sequences.

In some applications, however, there is a natural hierarchy of concepts that ought to be reflected in the unsupervised analysis. For example, in the neurosciences image sequence considered here, there are the semantic concepts of pixel $\rightarrow$ neuron $\rightarrow$ assembly that should find their counterpart in the unsupervised analysis. Driven by this concrete problem, we propose a decomposition of the matrix of observations into a product of more than two sparse matrices, with the rank decreasing from lower to higher levels. In contrast to prior work, we allow for both hierarchical and heterarchical relations of lower-level to higher-level concepts. In addition, we learn the nature of these relations rather than imposing them. Finally, we describe an optimization scheme that allows to optimize the decomposition over all levels jointly, rather than in a greedy level-by-level fashion.   The proposed bilevel SHMF (sparse heterarchical matrix factorization) is the first formalism that allows to simultaneously interpret a calcium imaging sequence in terms of the constituent neurons, their membership in assemblies, and the time courses of both neurons and assemblies.  Experiments show that the proposed model fully recovers the structure from difficult synthetic data designed to imitate the experimental data. More importantly, bilevel SHMF yields plausible interpretations of real-world Calcium imaging data.</span></div></p></body></html>
